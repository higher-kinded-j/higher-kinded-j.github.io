# Record Mapping Basics

_Declare one interface; get a `build` that cannot fail and a `parse` that reports every bad field at once._

Most mappings are boring, and the mapper treats them that way: same-named, same-typed components match automatically, and one empty interface is the whole declaration. This page walks the happy path first: declare, build, parse, read the errors, convert a field, and meet a `null`. Renames and computed fields follow, for when you need them. The mapper needs Java 25 and the hkj Gradle plugin, and the [Quickstart](quickstart.md) sets both up. The precise rules live on a page of their own, [Rules and Limits](rules.md).

~~~admonish info title="What You'll Learn"
- Declare a mapping as a `MappingSpec<Domain, Wire>` interface, and keep its generated Impl in the calling code, never on the spec
- Use a `parse` result: the value, or every bad field at once, each located by its path
- Convert a field whose type differs with a `ValidatedPrism` leaf
- Predict what `parse` does with a `null`

## Your first mapping {#your-first-mapping}

The whole declaration is an empty interface naming the pair, domain first and wire second. The wire is the DTO: the shape that crosses the network. Most examples here map the records of an order service, starting with its `Address`.

``` java
record Address(String street, String city, String postcode) {}

record AddressDto(String street, String city, String postcode) {}

@GenerateMapping
interface AddressMapping extends MappingSpec<Address, AddressDto> {}


    Address address = new Address("1 High Street", "Leeds", "LS1 4AP");
    AddressMappingImpl addressMapping = AddressMappingImpl.INSTANCE; // bind once, reuse

    // Same-named, same-typed components match automatically:
    AddressDto dto = addressMapping.build(address); // total
    Validated<NonEmptyList<FieldError>, Address> back =
        addressMapping.parse(dto); // accumulating, located
```

That is all of it: no mapper class, no configuration. The processor derives both directions from the two records at compile time, without reflection. It re-derives them on every compile, so the mapping cannot drift away from the records it maps. Add a wire component that nothing fills, and the build stops: [`has more components than`](compiler_errors.md#wire-has-more-components).

The two directions have different shapes, and that asymmetry runs through the whole chapter:

```
   build : Domain ──▶ DTO      total, always succeeds
   parse : DTO ──▶ Domain      fallible, reports every bad field at once
                               Validated<NonEmptyList<FieldError>, Domain>
```

A [`Validated`](../monads/validated_monad.md) holds either the parsed value (`Valid`) or every error (`Invalid`), and a [`NonEmptyList`](../monads/nonemptylist_monad.md) is a list with at least one element.

The processor generates `AddressMappingImpl` in the spec's package, and you reach it through its `INSTANCE` constant. A spec nested in an outer class joins the enclosing simple names: `Shop.CustomerMapping` generates `ShopCustomerMappingImpl`. A [generic spec](generics.md#one-rule-three-access-shapes) is reached through `instance()` or `of(...)` instead.

### Bind in the caller, not on the spec {#bind-in-the-caller}

Code that calls a mapping more than once keeps the Impl in a variable, as `addressMapping` does, and reuses it. Reading `INSTANCE` costs nothing, so the variable is only for readability. Type it as the Impl, since `build` and `parse` live there, not on the spec. A local suits a few calls in one method, and a `private static final` field suits a class that maps in several methods. In Spring, register the mapping as a `ValidatedPrism` bean and inject that, as the example app does:

``` java
@Configuration
public class MappingConfiguration {

  /**
   * The user wire codec: parse a {@link UserDto} into the domain, or render a {@link User} back.
   *
   * @return the generated mapping's {@link ValidatedPrism} surface
   */
  @Bean
  public ValidatedPrism<UserDto, User> userCodec() {
    return UserMappingImpl.INSTANCE.asValidatedPrism();
  }
}
```

[Injecting and testing generated mappings](testing.md#injecting-and-testing-generated-mappings) lists the surface to register for each kind of mapping.

Never keep the Impl in a constant on the spec, MapStruct's habit. Once the spec declares a leaf, the constant can read `null`, depending on which class a program uses first. The processor warns at one ([A spec never holds its Impl in a constant](rules.md#impl-constant-on-a-spec)).

~~~admonish warning title="Not checked for you: a surface of the Impl held on the spec"
A constant on the spec holding something built from the Impl, such as its `ValidatedPrism`, draws no warning, because the processor reads a constant's type, not its initialiser. The `contact()` leaf arms it, as before:

``` java
// A surface of the Impl held on the spec: no warning, and never do this either.
record Locker(String code, EmailAddress contact) {}

record LockerDto(String code, String contact) {}

@GenerateMapping
interface LockerMapping extends MappingSpec<Locker, LockerDto> {
  ValidatedPrism<LockerDto, Locker> PRISM = LockerMappingImpl.INSTANCE.asValidatedPrism();

  default ValidatedPrism<String, EmailAddress> contact() {
    return EmailCodecs.EMAIL;
  }
}

```

This one fails harder than a `null`. A program that uses `LockerMappingImpl.INSTANCE` first evaluates `PRISM` while `INSTANCE` is still `null`, so the Impl fails to initialise with an `ExceptionInInitializerError`, and every later use throws `NoClassDefFoundError`. Keep the Impl and its surfaces in the calling code.
~~~

## Validated leaves {#validated-leaves}

Real boundaries convert: the wire sends a `String`, and the domain wants an email that has already been checked. A **leaf** is the conversion at a single field, where the mapping stops copying and one wire value becomes one domain value. Think of it as a Jackson serialiser and deserialiser for one field, except that a bad value comes back as an error naming the field, not an exception. The leaf itself is a [`ValidatedPrism`](../optics/validated_prism.md), two functions: a parse that may reject, and a render back to the wire that cannot fail:

``` java
record EmailAddress(String value) {}

final class EmailCodecs {
  static final ValidatedPrism<String, EmailAddress> EMAIL =
      ValidatedPrism.of(
          raw ->
              raw.contains("@")
                  ? Validated.validNel(new EmailAddress(raw))
                  : Validated.invalidNel(FieldError.of("not an email address")),
          EmailAddress::value);

  private EmailCodecs() {}
}

```

`validNel` and `invalidNel` build the two outcomes. The leaf's error carries only a message, and `parse` adds the field's path.

Attach it to the spec as a zero-parameter `default` method named after the domain component:

``` java
record Customer(String name, EmailAddress email) {}

record CustomerDto(String name, String email) {}

@GenerateMapping
interface CustomerMapping extends MappingSpec<Customer, CustomerDto> {
  default ValidatedPrism<String, EmailAddress> email() { // wire first, domain second
    return EmailCodecs.EMAIL;
  }
}


    Validated<NonEmptyList<FieldError>, Customer> parsed =
        CustomerMappingImpl.INSTANCE.parse(new CustomerDto("Bob", "not-an-email"));
    // Invalid(NonEmptyList[email: not an email address])
```

The Impl reads the leaf once, on first use, and keeps what it answers, as [Your own canon](codecs.md#your-own-canon) explains.

The two type-argument orders are opposite. `ValidatedPrism<Wire, Domain>` reads the way `parse` runs, from wire to domain. `MappingSpec<Domain, Wire>` puts your domain type first.

The failure is a value, not an exception. It names the field by the domain component's name, whatever key the JSON used, as [Renames](#renames-mapfield) explains. With several bad fields, `parse` reports them all at once, so the client fixes everything in one round trip. Outside a controller, `fold` the result, with one function for the errors and one for the value. `Valid` and `Invalid` are records, so a `switch` works too:

``` java
    // One function for every error, one for the value:
    List<String> report =
        parsed.fold(
            errors -> errors.map(e -> e.pathString() + " -> " + e.message()).toJavaList(),
            customer -> List.of());
    // [email -> not an email address]
```

~~~admonish tip title="At the Spring boundary"
Returned as-is from a controller, the result becomes the single 422 response the Quickstart showed: [the 422 leg](../spring/spring_boot_integration.md#the-422-leg).
~~~

~~~admonish warning title="Not checked for you: keep a converted wire field a `String`"
Jackson binds the request before `parse` runs. Type a wire field that a leaf converts as a `String`. Typed as a `LocalDate` or an enum, a bad value fails inside Jackson, and the client gets Jackson's 400 instead of a located error. The Quickstart's [Read the 422](quickstart.md#4-read-the-422) step shows the difference.
~~~

Most leaves come ready-made: [Standard Codecs](codecs.md), the next page, covers identifiers, dates, enums and money. Coming from Bean Validation? [From Bean Validation](from_mapstruct.md#from-bean-validation) translates the common annotations.

~~~admonish note title="A leaf can check a field that needs no conversion"
An explicit leaf wins even when both types are identical, so a `ValidatedPrism<String, String>` can validate a field that would otherwise be copied. Check, but do not clean up: a parse that trims `" ada@example.com"` accepts a spelling `build` never writes back. That breaks the [section law](../optics/validated_prism.md#laws): an accepted wire value must rebuild to exactly itself. Reject the spaces instead.
~~~

## Null has an address, not a stack trace {#null-doctrine}

Jackson leaves a missing property `null`, so a boundary meets nulls constantly. The rule: **`parse` checks every value it reads from the wire, and a `null` becomes a `must not be null` error at that field's path, reported beside every other bad field, never thrown.**

``` java
    Validated<NonEmptyList<FieldError>, Customer> missing =
        CustomerMappingImpl.INSTANCE.parse(new CustomerDto(null, "not-an-email"));
    // Invalid(NonEmptyList[name: must not be null, email: not an email address])
```

The path reaches into nested records (`customer.name`) and lists (`lines.1`, the second line item). A `null` never reaches a leaf, so a leaf needs no null check of its own.

A primitive wire component, such as an `int` quantity, never holds a `null`, so the rule does not reach it: what a missing or malformed one becomes is Jackson's decision.

~~~admonish tip title="Why this matters"
Compare the alternatives you have debugged before: an NPE with a stack trace pointing into generated code, or Jackson's `MismatchedInputException` naming a Java class. A located error names the field by its path, sits beside every other defect in the same response, and costs the client one round trip instead of one per `null`.
~~~

The exact contract, including what happens inside containers, is in [The null contract, precisely](rules.md#the-null-contract-precisely). A `null` DTO passed to `parse` still throws, since that one is the caller's bug. A field whose `null` *means* something can opt out of this rule, one field at a time, as [Absent Fields and Record Invariants](absence.md#optional-bridge) shows.

~~~admonish tip title="You can ship now"
You can now map a record DTO to a domain record and back, check each field as it arrives, and answer with every bad field at once. Every field is required: to let one be left out, see [Absent Fields](absence.md#optional-bridge). The rest of this page, [renames](#renames-mapfield) and [computed wire fields](#derived-wire-fields), is for when a pair needs them.
~~~

~~~admonish question title="Checkpoint: which `MAPPER` can read `null`?" id="check-basics-constant"
Both of these specs carry the MapStruct-style constant, with the processor's warning on it suppressed. In each program, some code uses the Impl's `INSTANCE` before anything reads the spec's `MAPPER`. Afterwards, which `MAPPER` can read `null`?

``` java
// The MapStruct idiom, on two specs: never do this.
record Warehouse(String code, int bays) {}

record WarehouseDto(String code, int bays) {}

@GenerateMapping
interface WarehouseMapping extends MappingSpec<Warehouse, WarehouseDto> {
  @SuppressWarnings("impl-constant") // kept to show the trap
  WarehouseMappingImpl MAPPER = WarehouseMappingImpl.INSTANCE;
}

record Courier(String name, EmailAddress email) {}

record CourierDto(String name, String email) {}

@GenerateMapping
interface CourierMapping extends MappingSpec<Courier, CourierDto> {
  @SuppressWarnings("impl-constant") // kept to show the trap
  CourierMappingImpl MAPPER = CourierMappingImpl.INSTANCE;

  default ValidatedPrism<String, EmailAddress> email() {
    return EmailCodecs.EMAIL;
  }
}

```

1. Neither: an interface constant is set before any code can use it
2. `WarehouseMapping.MAPPER` only
3. `CourierMapping.MAPPER` only
4. Both
~~~

~~~admonish success title="Answer and why" collapsible=true id="check-basics-constant-answer"
**3.** `CourierMapping` declares a leaf, so using `CourierMappingImpl.INSTANCE` first leaves its `MAPPER` `null` for good. `WarehouseMapping` has no leaf, so its constant is safe, for now:

``` java
    // Two programs, each loading this package afresh and using the Impl before MAPPER:
    assertThat(mapperAfterFirstUsing("WarehouseMappingImpl", "WarehouseMapping")) // no leaf
        .isNotNull();
    assertThat(mapperAfterFirstUsing("CourierMappingImpl", "CourierMapping")) // a leaf
        .isNull();
```

The day someone adds a leaf to `WarehouseMapping`, its constant breaks too, which is why the processor warns on both. Delete both constants, and keep each Impl in the calling code.

Where this lives: [Bind in the caller, not on the spec](#bind-in-the-caller).
~~~

~~~admonish question title="Checkpoint: does a `null` reach the leaf?" id="check-basics-null"
`CustomerMapping` converts `email` through the [email leaf](#validated-leaves), which calls `raw.contains("@")`. What does `CustomerMappingImpl.INSTANCE.parse(new CustomerDto(null, null))` return?

1. It throws a `NullPointerException` from the leaf's `raw.contains("@")`
2. Invalid, with `name: must not be null` only
3. Invalid, with `name: must not be null` and `email: must not be null`
4. Invalid, with `name: must not be null` and `email: not an email address`
~~~

~~~admonish success title="Answer and why" collapsible=true id="check-basics-null-answer"
**3.** Each `null` becomes a located error, and neither stops the other. The null check runs before the leaf, so the leaf never sees the `null` email:

``` java
    assertThatValidated(CustomerMappingImpl.INSTANCE.parse(new CustomerDto(null, null)))
        .hasFieldErrors("name: must not be null", "email: must not be null");
```

Where this lives: [Null has an address, not a stack trace](#null-doctrine).
~~~

## Renames: `@MapField` {#renames-mapfield}

When the wire calls it `fullName` and the domain calls it `name`, as a partner's customer feed might, declare an abstract method named after the *domain* component, with `to` naming the *wire* component:

``` java
record PartnerCustomerDto(String fullName, String email) {} // a partner's customer feed

@GenerateMapping
interface PartnerCustomerMapping extends MappingSpec<Customer, PartnerCustomerDto> {
  @MapField(to = "fullName")
  String name(); // Customer.name <-> PartnerCustomerDto.fullName

  default ValidatedPrism<String, EmailAddress> email() {
    return EmailCodecs.EMAIL;
  }
}

```

Each wire component takes exactly one domain source, so the processor refuses two renames onto one name. Give the method the domain component's type, as `String name()` does. The Impl only names the method, and never calls it.

The `email` leaf comes along because this spec maps the whole `Customer`, and each spec declares the leaves its own pair needs. A [mix-in](codecs.md#shared-vocabulary-mix-in-interfaces) declares them once for several specs. The [Capstone](capstone.md)'s `CustomerDto` makes the same rename.

~~~admonish note title="Error paths use domain names, not JSON keys"
A client that sent `fullName` gets its errors at `name`. The same holds for a Jackson rename: under `@JsonProperty("first_name")` on a `firstName` component, or a snake_case naming strategy, the path stays `firstName`. Every path in the system is domain-named, so paths stay consistent, and stable when the wire is refactored. A client that maps errors back onto its own payload keys applies the renames in reverse.
~~~

### Renamed and converted {#renamed-and-converted}

A mailing list's export calls the email `emailAddress`, and its string still has to be checked into an `EmailAddress`. The leaf is already the component's one method named `email()`, and a rename marker beside it would be a second `email()`, which Java refuses. So `@MapField` goes on the leaf, and means both:

``` java
record MailingListCustomerDto(String name, String emailAddress) {} // a mailing list's export

@GenerateMapping
interface MailingListCustomerMapping extends MappingSpec<Customer, MailingListCustomerDto> {
  @MapField(to = "emailAddress") // Customer.email <-> MailingListCustomerDto.emailAddress
  default ValidatedPrism<String, EmailAddress> email() { // renamed, and converted
    return EmailCodecs.EMAIL;
  }
}

```

The error still names the domain component:

``` java
    Validated<NonEmptyList<FieldError>, Customer> subscribed =
        MailingListCustomerMappingImpl.INSTANCE.parse(
            new MailingListCustomerDto("Ada", "not-an-email"));
    // Invalid(NonEmptyList[email: not an email address])
```

---

## Derived wire fields {#derived-wire-fields}

A wire component with **no domain counterpart** can be computed from the whole domain value: a `displayName` the domain does not store, because it is derivable. Declare a zero-parameter `default` method named after the *wire* component, returning `Getter<Domain, WireComponentType>`. Read the `Getter` as a `Function<Domain, WireComponentType>`: `Getter.of` takes a plain lambda. A primitive component takes its wrapper, `Getter<Domain, Integer>` for an `int`, which `build` unboxes.

``` java
record Recipient(String first, String last) {}

record RecipientDto(String first, String last, String displayName) {}

@GenerateMapping
interface RecipientMapping extends MappingSpec<Recipient, RecipientDto> {
  default Getter<Recipient, String> displayName() {
    return Getter.of(r -> r.first() + " " + r.last());
  }
}


    RecipientDto built = RecipientMappingImpl.INSTANCE.build(new Recipient("Ada", "Lovelace"));
    // RecipientDto[first=Ada, last=Lovelace, displayName=Ada Lovelace]
```

The two directions are asymmetric: `build` computes the derived component, and `parse` throws it away, since the data is derivable and nothing is lost. A client that sends `displayName` has it ignored, not checked.

```
  build : fills the derived component from the whole domain value
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Recipient(first, last) ──▶ RecipientDto(first, last, displayName)
                                                       ▲
               displayName() : Getter<Recipient,String>│  first + " " + last
                                                       └── computed, not copied

  parse : ignores the derived component (it is derivable)
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  RecipientDto(first, last, displayName) ──▶ Valid(Recipient(first, last))
                            └── displayName dropped, never read
```

[Spec members](rules.md#spec-members) says how the processor tells a leaf from a derived field, and [What Your Spec Generates](tiers.md) what a derived field changes in the generated methods.

~~~admonish info title="Key Takeaways"
* **A mapping is an interface you own**: `@GenerateMapping` on a `MappingSpec<Domain, Wire>` generates `<Spec>Impl` with `build` and `parse`, which the calling code keeps, never a constant on the spec
* **Two directions, two shapes**: `build` is total, and `parse` returns the value or every bad field at once, each located by a domain-named path
* **Leaves convert, renames rename, getters derive**: `ValidatedPrism` leaves for fields whose types differ, `@MapField` for names, `Getter` defaults for wire-only fields
* **Null is located, never thrown**: a `null` becomes `must not be null` at its path, inside containers too, and never reaches a leaf
