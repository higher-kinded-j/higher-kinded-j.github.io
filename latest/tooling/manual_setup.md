# Manual Gradle and Maven Setup

~~~admonish info title="What You'll Learn"
- Full manual `build.gradle.kts` configuration for Higher-Kinded-J
- Full manual `pom.xml` configuration for Higher-Kinded-J
- Snapshot repository configuration for both build tools
~~~

Most projects should use the [HKJ build plugin](gradle_plugin.md): a single line replaces all the boilerplate below. This page documents the full manual configuration for the projects that cannot use the plugin (constrained environments, in-house build frameworks, or plugins that conflict with the HKJ plugin). If the plugin is an option for you, start there instead.

Both configurations below pin the release to **25** and enable preview features, which go together: `javac` accepts `--enable-preview` only for the release it is running on, so the toolchain has to be Java 25 as well. [Prerequisites](../quickstart.md#prerequisites) explains what the flag is for, and where it is genuinely needed.

The Spring Boot starter, and the processor that generates `@HkjHttpClient` clients, are not covered here: [Declarative HTTP Clients](../spring/declarative_http_clients.md#step-1-add-the-starter) shows both, for Gradle and Maven.

## Gradle Manual Setup

```gradle
// build.gradle.kts
plugins { java }

java {
    toolchain {
        languageVersion.set(JavaLanguageVersion.of(25))
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.higher-kinded-j:hkj-core:LATEST_VERSION")

    // The annotation processor: generates the optics, Focus paths and Effect paths your annotations ask for
    annotationProcessor("io.github.higher-kinded-j:hkj-processor-plugins:LATEST_VERSION")
}

// Enable Java preview features, for code that reaches the preview classes (see Prerequisites)
tasks.withType<JavaCompile>().configureEach {
    options.compilerArgs.add("--enable-preview")
}

tasks.withType<Test>().configureEach {
    jvmArgs("--enable-preview")
}

tasks.withType<JavaExec>().configureEach {
    jvmArgs("--enable-preview")
}
```

### Gradle SNAPSHOT Configuration

For SNAPSHOT versions of HKJ, add the Sonatype snapshots repository:

```gradle
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven {
        url = uri("https://central.sonatype.com/repository/maven-snapshots/")
    }
}
```

### Maven SNAPSHOT Configuration

For SNAPSHOT versions, add the Sonatype snapshots repository to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>central-snapshots</id>
        <url>https://central.sonatype.com/repository/maven-snapshots/</url>
        <snapshots>
            <enabled>true</enabled>
        </snapshots>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

~~~admonish tip title="Prefer the Plugin"
The [HKJ build plugin](gradle_plugin.md) handles all of the above (dependencies, preview flags, annotation processors, and compile-time Path type checking) with a single `plugins { }` block. Unless you have a specific reason to avoid it, the plugin is the recommended path.

## Incremental compilation

The HKJ annotation processors register with Gradle's incremental annotation processing: the processors that generate code as aggregating, since cross-spec features such as nested mapping resolution may read any annotated element in the compilation and the mapping processors also read the classpath index described below; and `CompanionAnnotationProcessor`, which generates nothing and claims hkj's annotations so that `-Xlint:processing` does not report them, as isolating. A source set using them keeps incremental compilation; no configuration is needed. Unregistered third-party processors on the same processor path disable incrementality for the whole source set, so if compile times regress, audit the other entries on the path first.

## Multi-module builds

A `@GenerateMapping` spec compiled in one module is found by the specs of another through an index the processor writes beside each generated `Impl` ([Across modules](../mapping/structure.md#across-modules) explains the resolution). The index travels in the jar as an empty class in the package `org.higherkindedj.mapping.index`, and four things follow for the build:

- **Every module that declares specs needs `hkj-processor` on its processor path**, not only the one that nests them. A module compiled without it has no `Impl` and no index entry, and a downstream spec reports its pair as having no usable source.
- **A spec newly added to a dependency may need a clean downstream build.** Gradle recompiles a source set when its classpath changes, but chooses which sources to recompile from what they reference, and no downstream source references an index entry. Until the downstream module is rebuilt from clean, or one of its sources changes, the new spec can go unseen.
- **The index is classpath-only.** A module with a `module-info` neither writes nor reads it, not supported yet, since the index is one package that two modules cannot share; for the same reason two spec-carrying jars cannot serve as automatic modules side by side. Across such a boundary, delegate with a leaf calling the other `Impl`'s `asValidatedPrism()`.
- **The index can be turned off.** The processor option `-Ahkj.mapping.index=false` (in Gradle, `options.compilerArgs.add("-Ahkj.mapping.index=false")` on the compile task) makes a compilation write no entries and read none, which is what a library bound for a module path beside other spec-carrying jars wants. A downstream spec that then cannot find a pair says the index is off.

A [shared vocabulary](../mapping/codecs.md#shared-vocabulary-mix-in-interfaces) is the exception to all four, because it is a plain interface rather than a spec and is found by ordinary inheritance rather than through the index. The module publishing one needs **no processor at all**, only the library its members name (`hkj-core` for a `ValidatedPrism` leaf, `hkj-api` for a `Getter`), and none of the caveats above apply to it: no index entry to go unseen, and a `module-info` or a disabled index does not stop a downstream spec extending it. So the module that owns an API's house vocabulary need not be a mapping module at all. What it does need is to be on the compile classpath wherever a spec extending it is used. A dependency's spec is read from its class file against the consumer's compile classpath, so a vocabulary the dependency declares with `implementation` leaves that spec unreadable downstream: a use site nesting it fails, naming the missing interface. Either the consumer declares the vocabulary's module itself, or the dependency exposes it with `api` rather than `implementation`, which needs the `java-library` plugin applied alongside HKJ's.

Navigators across modules use no index either. A [navigator](../optics/focus_navigation.md#which-fields-get-a-navigator) into a record declared in a dependency composes the `Focus` class that dependency generated, so **a module whose `@GenerateFocus` records are navigated from elsewhere needs the processor too**; without it, a consumer keeps the plain path for those fields and says so in a note. A consumer composes only what the dependency published, so the two need not share a processor version or generator plugins to compile. What a consumer does need is to see the types a field names: a field whose type comes from one of the dependency's own dependencies is left out of the consumer's navigator, with a note, unless that type is on the consumer's compile classpath. Either the consumer declares that module itself, or the dependency exposes it with `api` rather than `implementation`, which needs the `java-library` plugin applied alongside HKJ's, since HKJ's applies plain `java`. As with specs, a dependency newly given the processor may need a clean downstream build before its records become navigable: no downstream source references the new `Focus` classes, so Gradle has nothing to recompile.

## Lombok {#lombok}

Lombok and the HKJ processors run in the same javac invocation, and the pairing is covered by a test in the HKJ build: a `@Data` class works as a bean-shaped `@GenerateMapping` wire, with the generated getters and setters visible to the bean analyser. **Order matters: list Lombok before `hkj-processor`** (within a javac round, processors run in listed order, and the bean analyser needs the accessors already materialised; the reverse order fails with a clear diagnostic). No binding artefact is needed beyond that:

```gradle
dependencies {
    annotationProcessor("org.projectlombok:lombok:LOMBOK_VERSION")
    annotationProcessor("io.github.higher-kinded-j:hkj-processor:LATEST_VERSION")
    compileOnly("org.projectlombok:lombok:LOMBOK_VERSION")
}
```

## Mapping over types other processors generate {#mapping-over-types-other-processors-generate}

A mapping may name a type another annotation processor writes in the same compilation: a wire class generated from a schema, say, or a value type another library generates. Such a type does not exist until the processing round after the one that writes it, so the mapping processors wait for it. A `@GenerateMapping` or `@GenerateMerge` spec whose domain or wire type, or anything read from them (a record component, a bean property, a builder, a mix-in method), names a type not written yet is generated once that type exists, and so is any spec that nests it. It maps exactly as it would were the type written by hand, and nothing needs configuring.

If the type never appears, for example because the processor that writes it is missing from the processor path, the spec generates nothing. javac's own error names the missing type, and code that uses the spec's `Impl` reports that `Impl` missing too; supply the type and both errors go.
