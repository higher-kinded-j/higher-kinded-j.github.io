# Benchmarks & Performance

Higher-Kinded-J ships with a comprehensive JMH benchmark suite in the `hkj-benchmarks` module. These benchmarks measure the real cost of the library's abstractions so you can make informed decisions about where and when to use them.

## Why Benchmarks Matter

Functional abstractions wrap values. Wrapping has a cost. The question is never "is there overhead?" (there always is) but "does the overhead matter for my workload?" The benchmark suite answers that question with data rather than intuition.

The suite is designed around three principles:

1. **Honesty**: measure real abstraction costs, not contrived best cases
2. **Comparability**: include raw Java baselines alongside library operations
3. **Actionability**: organise results so regressions are immediately visible

---

## What Is Measured

The `hkj-benchmarks` module contains 24 benchmark classes covering every major type in the library:

### Core Types

| Benchmark | Type | What It Tells You |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| `EitherBenchmark` | `Either<L,R>` | Instance reuse on the Left track, short-circuit efficiency |
| `MaybeBenchmark` | `Maybe<A>` | Instance reuse on Nothing, nullable interop cost |
| `TrampolineBenchmark` | `Trampoline<A>` | Stack-safe recursion overhead vs naive recursion |
| `FreeBenchmark` | `Free<F,A>` | Free monad interpretation cost |
| `FreeEffectBenchmark` | `Free`, `EitherF` | Effect handler overhead: `EitherF` dispatch, `Free.translate`, error handling, combined interpreters and program analysis |
| `FoldPlusBenchmark` | `Fold` | `Fold.plus` and `Fold.sum` against a single fold and a manual `Stream.concat` |

### Effect Types

| Benchmark | Type | What It Tells You |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| `IOBenchmark` | `IO<A>` | Lazy construction and platform thread execution |
| `VTaskBenchmark` | `VTask<A>` | Virtual thread execution, map/flatMap chains |
| `VStreamBenchmark` | `VStream<A>` | Pull-based stream construction, combinator pipelines, parallel ops, chunking, Java Stream comparison |
| `VTaskParBenchmark` | `Par` combinators | Parallel zip, all, race, traverse via StructuredTaskScope |
| `ScopeBenchmark` | `Scope`, `Resource` | Scope joiner strategies (allSucceed, anySucceed, accumulating), Resource bracket overhead |

### Effect Path Wrappers

| Benchmark | Type | What It Tells You |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| `VTaskPathBenchmark` | `VTaskPath<A>` | Wrapper overhead on top of VTask |
| `IOPathBenchmark` | `IOPath<A>` | Wrapper overhead on top of IO |
| `ForPathVTaskBenchmark` | ForPath with VTask | For-comprehension tuple allocation cost |

### Comparisons

| Benchmark | What It Compares |
|-----------|-----------------|
| `VTaskVsIOBenchmark` | Virtual threads vs platform threads |
| `VTaskVsPlatformThreadsBenchmark` | VTask vs ExecutorService at scale |
| `VTaskPathVsIOPathBenchmark` | Path wrapper costs across effect types |
| `AbstractionOverheadBenchmark` | HKJ abstractions vs raw Java |
| `ConcurrencyScalingBenchmark` | Thread scaling under concurrent load |
| `MemoryFootprintBenchmark` | Allocation rates for VTask, IO, CompletableFuture |
| `PCollectionsHktBenchmark` | PCollections `PVector` against `ArrayList` through `ListMonad` and `ListTraverse` |

### Mapping

| Benchmark | What It Compares |
|-----------|-----------------|
| `MappingBenchmark` | The generated mapper's `build` and `parse` against a hand-written mapper, MapStruct, and MapStruct with Bean Validation, on a nested pair and a flat one |

### Scaling

Each of these runs at two sizes, ten times apart, so a test can check that the cost grows in proportion to the input.

| Benchmark | What It Measures |
|-----------|-----------------|
| `AccumulationBenchmark` | Collecting every failure of a bulk parse, `Edits.accumulate`, `PathOps.traverseValidated` and a generated mapping's null scan |
| `EachRebuildBenchmark` | Modifying every element through a Focus path's `.each()` on a `List`, and through `EachInstances.arrayEach()` |

## Running Benchmarks

### All Benchmarks

```bash
./gradlew :hkj-benchmarks:jmh
```

### A Single Benchmark Class

```bash
./gradlew :hkj-benchmarks:jmh --includes=".*VStreamBenchmark.*"
./gradlew :hkj-benchmarks:jmh --includes=".*VTaskBenchmark.*"
./gradlew :hkj-benchmarks:jmh --includes=".*EitherBenchmark.*"
```

### A Single Benchmark Method

```bash
./gradlew :hkj-benchmarks:jmh --includes=".*VTaskBenchmark.runSucceed.*"
```

### With GC Profiling

This reveals allocation rates and GC pressure, essential for understanding memory behaviour:

```bash
./gradlew :hkj-benchmarks:jmh -Pjmh.profilers=gc
```

### Long / Stress Mode

Runs with `chainDepth=10000` and `recursionDepth=10000` for thorough stack-safety validation:

```bash
./gradlew :hkj-benchmarks:longBenchmark
```

### The Mapping Benchmark {#the-mapping-benchmark}

A quick run goes through Gradle:

```bash
./gradlew :hkj-benchmarks:jmh -Pincludes=".*MappingBenchmark.*"
```

For figures worth quoting, run the benchmark jar directly: more iterations, four forks, time per operation, and the allocation per operation. Two forks can settle into different compiled code and disagree; four show which figure is typical:

```bash
./gradlew :hkj-benchmarks:jmhJar
java --enable-preview -jar hkj-benchmarks/build/libs/hkj-benchmarks-<version>-jmh.jar MappingBenchmark \
  -wi 3 -w 1s -i 5 -r 1s -f 4 -bm avgt -tu ns -jvmArgs "--enable-preview" -prof gc
```

Run it on a quiet machine. Another build running at the same time shows up as forks that disagree with each other. A filtered Gradle run overwrites `build/reports/jmh/results.json`, and a later local build then runs the assertion tests against it and fails, because they expect every benchmark class. Delete the file, or run the whole suite, before building.

### Formatted Report

```bash
./gradlew :hkj-benchmarks:benchmarkReport
```

---

## Reading the Output

JMH reports throughput in operations per microsecond. Higher is better.

```
Benchmark                                    Mode  Cnt   Score   Error   Units
EitherBenchmark.rightMap                   thrpt   20  15.234 ± 0.512  ops/us
EitherBenchmark.leftMap                    thrpt   20  89.123 ± 1.234  ops/us
```

**Score** is the measured throughput. **Error** is the 99.9% confidence interval. If the error is larger than ~30% of the score, the result is noisy. Increase warmup or measurement iterations.

### What to Look For

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Left/Nothing operations 5-40x faster than Right/Just | Instance reuse is working |
| VTask ~10-30% slower than IO for simple ops | Expected virtual thread overhead |
| VTask blocking I/O 10x+ faster than platform threads at scale | Virtual thread scheduler scaling |
| Deep chain (50+ steps) completes without error | Stack safety is intact |
| VStream slower than Java Stream | Expected; virtual thread + pull overhead |
| parEvalMap scales with concurrency for I/O | Parallel pipeline working correctly |
| Scope joiners similar speed to Par.all | Minimal Scope abstraction cost |
| Wrapper overhead < 15% | Acceptable Path wrapper cost |
| PVector via ListKind 30-70% the throughput of ArrayList | Persistent collection iteration tax |

### Warning Signs

| Signal | Possible Cause |
|--------|---------------|
| Left/Nothing same speed as Right/Just | Instance reuse broken |
| Error margin > 50% of score | Noisy environment, insufficient warmup |
| Deep chain throws StackOverflowError | Stack safety regression |
| VStream > 100x slower than Java Stream | Excessive allocation in pull loop |
| Wrapper overhead > 30% | Unnecessary allocation in Path wrapper |

---

## Expected Performance by Type

### Either and Maybe

These types use **instance reuse**: `Left` and `Nothing` operations return the same object without allocating, making short-circuit paths essentially free.

| Comparison | Expected Ratio |
|------------|---------------|
| `leftMap` vs `rightMap` | Left 5-10x faster |
| `nothingMap` vs `justMap` | Nothing 5-10x faster |
| `leftLongChain` vs `rightLongChain` | Left 10-50x faster |
| `constructNothing` vs `constructJust` | Singleton reuse can reach 30-40x |

The "construct" pair is the strongest signal that allocation, not branching, dominates the gap. `constructNothing` returns the cached singleton, whereas `constructJust` allocates a fresh wrapper. On hot paths producing many `Just` or `Right` values, that allocation cost is real.

### VTask

Virtual thread overhead is the dominant cost for simple operations. For real workloads involving I/O, this overhead is negligible, and the scheduling story flips dramatically in VTask's favour.

| Comparison | Expected |
|------------|----------|
| Construction (succeed, delay) | Very fast (~100+ ops/us) |
| VTask vs IO (simple execution) | VTask ~10-30% slower |
| Deep chains (50+) | Completes without error |
| Blocking I/O at concurrency 10 | Roughly equivalent to platform threads |
| Blocking I/O at concurrency 100 | VTask ~3-4x faster |
| Blocking I/O at concurrency 1000 | VTask 15-20x faster |

The blocking I/O numbers come from `VTaskVsPlatformThreadsBenchmark`. Platform throughput collapses as concurrency grows because OS threads become the bottleneck; virtual thread throughput stays roughly flat because the scheduler parks blocked carriers freely. This is the strongest single argument for VTask in I/O-bound workloads.

### VStream

VStream's pull-based model adds overhead per element compared to Java Stream's push model, but provides laziness, virtual thread execution, and error recovery that Java Stream cannot.

| Comparison | Expected |
|------------|----------|
| Construction (empty, of, range) | Very fast (~100+ ops/us) |
| VStream map vs Java Stream map | VStream slower |
| Deep map chain (50) | Completes without error |
| Deep flatMap chain (50) | Completes without error |
| `existsEarlyMatch` vs `existsNoMatch` | Early match much faster (short-circuit) |

### Effect Path Wrappers

| Comparison | Expected Overhead |
|------------|-------------------|
| VTaskPath vs raw VTask | 5-15% |
| IOPath vs raw IO | 5-15% |
| ForPath vs direct chaining | 10-25% |

### PCollections via `ListKind`

`PCollectionsHktBenchmark` measures `PVector` against `ArrayList` when both are processed through the standard `ListMonad`/`ListTraverse` pipeline. The widen/narrow boundary itself is free; the cost lives in iteration.

| Comparison | Expected Ratio |
|------------|---------------|
| `widenNarrow` PVector vs ArrayList | Indistinguishable, both at the JMH ceiling |
| `map` / `flatMap` / `foldMap` PVector vs ArrayList | PVector 30-40% the throughput |
| `traverse` PVector vs ArrayList | PVector ~70% the throughput |

The traverse case is the headline result. The more applicative work an operation does per element, the smaller the gap, because applicative `map2` and `Kind` boxing dominate the underlying iteration cost. See [PCollections Integration](tooling/pcollections_integration.md) for the full table and methodology.

### Free Monad

`Free` trades raw speed for program-as-data: a `Free` programme can be inspected, transformed, or interpreted multiple ways before it is run. That flexibility costs at least three orders of magnitude versus direct function composition.

| Comparison | Expected Ratio |
|------------|---------------|
| `directComposition` vs `deepChainExecution` | Direct ~3-4 orders of magnitude faster |
| `pureTrampolineIntegration` vs `flatMappedTrampolineIntegration` | Pure ~100x faster |
| `programConstruction` vs `sequentialInterpretation` | Construction far cheaper than interpretation |

If a workload is on a hot path and does not benefit from inspection or alternative interpreters, prefer direct composition. `Free` shines when the same programme is interpreted multiple ways, when the structure is analysed before execution, or when the alternatives would require substantial duplication.

## Benchmark Assertion Tests

The benchmark suite includes automated assertion tests that validate performance characteristics after each benchmark run. These are not just "did it finish?" checks; they verify relative performance, overhead ratios, and sanity bounds.

~~~admonish warning title="Tests Fail If Benchmarks Haven't Run"
The assertion tests **fail** (not skip) if benchmark results are missing. This is intentional. Run `./gradlew :hkj-benchmarks:jmh` before running `./gradlew :hkj-benchmarks:test`. Silent skips hide missing quality gates.
~~~

### What the Tests Validate

| Test Group | What It Checks |
|------------|---------------|
| **SanityChecks** | Every benchmark has positive throughput and bounded error margins |
| **VTaskRelativePerformance** | VTask construction costs (succeed, of, map) are positive |
| **ParCombinatorPerformance** | Par.zip and Par.map2 have positive throughput |
| **VTaskVsIOOverhead** | Both VTask and IO construction perform within expected bounds |
| **CoreTypePerformance** | Maybe, Either, and Trampoline operations have positive throughput |
| **FoldPlusPerformance** | Fold combination overhead is bounded; `sum` vs `plus` parity |
| **AbstractionOverhead** | Raw Java > IO > VTask ordering; VTaskPath wrapper overhead bounded |
| **ConcurrencyScaling** | Single and multi-threaded VTask/IO performance is positive |
| **IOPerformance** | IO construction vs execution ratios; deep recursion completes (stack safety) |
| **IOPathPerformance** | IOPath construction, map pipelines, and error handling overhead |
| **VTaskPathPerformance** | VTaskPath construction, map pipelines, and timeout overhead |
| **VTaskPathVsIOPath** | Cross-type comparison: construction ratios and conversion costs |
| **ForPathVTaskPerformance** | For-comprehension overhead vs direct chaining; parallel step overhead |
| **ScopePerformance** | Scope.allSucceed, Resource bracket, and Par.all throughput |
| **MemoryFootprint** | Bulk construction rates for VTask, IO, and CompletableFuture |
| **VStreamPerformance** | VStream map execution, construction vs execution, Java Stream baseline |
| **VTaskVsPlatformThreads** | VTask Par.all vs platform thread pool at scale |
| **FreeMonadPerformance** | Free monad construction, stack safety, and interpretation overhead |
| **AccumulationScaling** | Ten times the failures cost under 30 times as long, where copying every earlier failure would cost about 100 |
| **EachRebuildScaling** | Ten times the elements cost under 30 times as long, where copying the list built so far at each element would cost about 100 |

### Running the Tests

```bash
# Step 1: Run benchmarks (generates results.json)
./gradlew :hkj-benchmarks:jmh

# Step 2: Run assertion tests against the results
./gradlew :hkj-benchmarks:test

# Or run both together via the benchmarkValidation task
./gradlew benchmarkValidation
```

## Release Quality Gate

The `releaseReadiness` task is a single-command quality gate that runs the build's verification steps and the two checks CI runs before its build, ordered from fastest to slowest so failures surface early. The book's own checks are separate: run `hkj-book/check.sh`.

```bash
./gradlew releaseReadiness
```

| Step | Task | What It Checks | Speed |
|------|------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | `britishSpellingCheck` | British spelling in the repository's prose; needs Node.js | Seconds |
| 2 | `spotlessCheck` | Code formatting (Google Java Format), in every module | Seconds |
| 3 | `:hkj-processor:verifyGoldenFiles` | The processor's golden files, regenerated, are identical to the committed copies | About a minute |
| 4 | `build` | Compilation and unit tests in every module except `hkj-benchmarks`, and the JaCoCo coverage limits of the modules that set them | Minutes |
| 5 | `:hkj-benchmarks:jmh` | JMH benchmarks execute successfully | Minutes |
| 6 | `:hkj-benchmarks:test` | Benchmark assertion tests pass | Seconds |
| 7 | `:hkj-processor:pitest` (full) | Mutation testing with STRONGER mutators | Slowest |

If any step fails, the build stops immediately. All seven must pass before a release.

- **Step 1** lists each American spelling it finds. `node .github/scripts/british-spelling-check.cjs --fix` rewrites them.
- **Step 3** refuses to start while a golden file has uncommitted changes, since it regenerates every golden file and would overwrite them. When it fails after regenerating, the regenerated files are left in place to review and commit.
- **Step 4** leaves out `hkj-benchmarks`, whose build includes the benchmark assertion tests: they run as step 6, once step 5 has written fresh results.

~~~admonish info title="Pitest Full Profile"
The release gate runs pitest with `-Ppitest.profile=full`, which uses STRONGER mutators and all available CPU cores. This is more thorough than the default conservative profile used during local development.

## When Overhead Matters (and When It Doesn't)

The benchmarks consistently show that abstraction overhead is measured in **nanoseconds**. Real-world operations (database queries, HTTP calls, file reads) are measured in **milliseconds**. The overhead is three to four orders of magnitude smaller than any I/O operation.

Abstraction overhead matters in exactly three scenarios:

1. **Tight computational loops** processing millions of items per second with no I/O. Use primitives directly.
2. **Very long chains** (hundreds of steps) creating GC pressure. Break into named submethods.
3. **Reflexive parallelism on trivial work.** `VTaskParBenchmark` shows `par*` variants running thousands of times slower than their sequential equivalents when the per-task work is negligible. Forking, joining, and synchronising all cost more than a few-nanosecond computation. Reach for `Par.zip`, `Par.map2`, or `Scope` only when each branch does enough work to amortise the structured-concurrency cost.

For everything else, the type safety, composability, and testability benefits far outweigh the cost.
