~~~

The Focus DSL never asks you which path type you want. It reads the field's type and picks: exactly one, zero or one, or zero or more. This page is the rule book for that choice.

---

## Generated Class Structure

Given a record with one field of each interesting shape:

```java
@GenerateLenses
@GenerateFocus
record Employee(
    String name,
    int age,
    Optional<String> email,
    List<Skill> skills,
    Either<String, Integer> timeout,
    Map<String, Integer> scores) {}
```

the processor generates one method per component, each already carrying the widening its type calls for:

<!-- verify -->
```java
FocusPath<Employee, String> name = EmployeeFocus.name();          // plain field
FocusPath<Employee, Integer> age = EmployeeFocus.age();           // boxed primitive

AffinePath<Employee, String> email = EmployeeFocus.email();       // .some()
TraversalPath<Employee, Skill> skills = EmployeeFocus.skills();   // .each()

// SPI ZERO_OR_ONE: .some(Affines.eitherRight())
AffinePath<Employee, Integer> timeout = EmployeeFocus.timeout();

// SPI ZERO_OR_MORE: not widened by default, so the path still focuses the Map
FocusPath<Employee, Map<String, Integer>> scores = EmployeeFocus.scores();
TraversalPath<Employee, Integer> allScores = scores.each(EachInstances.mapValuesEach());
```

Two things are worth noticing. There is exactly one method per component, so indexed accessors such as `skill(0)` are not generated; index with `.at(0)` from `FocusPath.of(EmployeeLenses.skills())` instead. And the `Map` field is the odd one out, which the next section explains.

---

## Cardinality: the Rule Behind the Choice

Every container holds its values in one of two ways. It either wraps *at most one* value (`Either` holds a success or a failure) or *zero or more* (a `Map` holds many entries). The Focus DSL calls this the container's **cardinality**, and it decides the generated path type:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    C{"How many values<br/>can the container hold?"}
    C -->|"exactly one<br/>(a plain field)"| F(["FocusPath"])
    C -->|"zero or one<br/>Optional, Maybe, Either, Try, Validated"| A(["AffinePath"])
    C -->|"zero or more<br/>List, Set, Collection, Map, arrays, third-party collections"| T(["TraversalPath"])

    classDef decision fill:#e5c890,stroke:#df8e1d,color:#232634
    classDef tier fill:#a6d189,stroke:#40a02b,color:#232634
    class C decision
    class F,A,T tier
```

The diagram gives the tier a container's cardinality *implies*. Which of them a static Focus method actually widens to is the next section's subject: `List`, `Set` and `Collection` always do, and the rest wait for `widenCollections`.

Nested containers compose the same rule up to three levels: `Optional<List<String>>` becomes `.some().each()` and lands on a `TraversalPath`. See [Nested Container Widening](focus_navigation.md#nested-container-widening).

### The `ZERO_OR_MORE` Asymmetry, and `widenCollections`

`List`, `Set` and `Collection` are recognised directly by the processor and widened at the static method. Every *other* `ZERO_OR_MORE` container arrives through the service-provider interface (SPI) (`Map`, arrays, and the third-party collections below) and is left un-widened by default, for backwards compatibility. One flag turns the widening on:

<!-- verify -->
```java
// Default: the static method stops at the container
FocusPath<Employee, Map<String, Integer>> scores = EmployeeFocus.scores();

// @GenerateFocus(widenCollections = true): the static method steps into it
TraversalPath<WidenedEmployee, Integer> widened = WidenedEmployeeFocus.scores();
```

~~~admonish tip title="Why this matters"
`widenCollections = true` is usually what you want on a new record: it makes `Map` fields behave exactly like `List` fields, and the same flag applies one level down inside a nested container. It is opt-in only because turning it on changes a method's return type, and that is a source-breaking change for anyone already calling it. New code has nothing to break.
~~~

There is one exception, and it is the one navigators need: a container whose *element* is itself a `@GenerateFocus` record is always stepped into, because the navigator that record's field hands back has to reach it. So `Map<String, Address>` on a navigator-enabled record gives you an `AddressNavigator` over the values without the flag, while `Map<String, String>` waits for it.

Whichever way you reach a field, by the static method or by a navigator on a record that holds this one, you get the same path type. The setting that decides it belongs to the record that *declares* the component, not to the one navigating to it.

## Supported Container Types

`ZERO_OR_ONE` containers, which produce an `AffinePath`:

| Container | Source | Optic used |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| `Optional<A>` | JDK | `.some()` (recognised directly) |
| `Maybe<A>` | HKJ | `Affines.just()` |
| `Either<L, R>` | HKJ | `Affines.eitherRight()` |
| `Try<A>` | HKJ | `Affines.trySuccess()` |
| `Validated<E, A>` | HKJ | `Affines.validatedValid()` |

`ZERO_OR_MORE` containers, which produce a `TraversalPath` (at the static method for the first three rows, which are recognised by name, and for the rest only under `widenCollections = true`):

| Container | Source | Optic used |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| `List<A>` | JDK | `.each()` (recognised directly) |
| `Set<A>` | JDK | `EachInstances.setEach()` (recognised directly) |
| `Collection<A>` | JDK | `EachInstances.collectionEach()` (recognised directly) |
| `Map<K, V>` | JDK | `EachInstances.mapValuesEach()` |
| `A[]` | JDK | `EachInstances.arrayEach()` |
| `ImmutableList`, `MutableList`, `ImmutableSet`, `MutableSet`, `ImmutableBag`, `MutableBag`, `ImmutableSortedSet`, `MutableSortedSet` | Eclipse Collections | `EachInstances.fromIterableCollecting(...)` |
| `ImmutableList`, `ImmutableSet` | Guava | `EachInstances.fromIterableCollecting(...)` |
| `List`, `Set` | Vavr | `EachInstances.fromIterableCollecting(...)` |
| `HashBag`, `UnmodifiableList` | Apache Commons | `EachInstances.fromIterableCollecting(...)` |
| `PVector`, `PStack`, `PSet`, `PSortedSet`, `PBag` | PCollections | `EachInstances.fromIterableCollecting(...)` |
| `PMap`, `PSortedMap` | PCollections | `EachInstances.mapValuesEachCollecting(...)` |

The three JDK collections are recognised by name rather than by the SPI, but they do not share one traversal: the no-argument `.each()` carries a `List` one, so a `Set` field is widened with `EachInstances.setEach()` and a `Collection` field with `EachInstances.collectionEach()`. Each rebuilds a value the component can take back, which is what lets the modified result go home:

<!-- verify -->
```java
// Each of these widened at the static method, through its own Each instance
TraversalPath<Team, Skill> teamSkills = TeamFocus.skills();
TraversalPath<Team, String> teamTags = TeamFocus.tags();

// The path is a TraversalPath, so the Set widened at the static method
Team promoted = teamSkills.via(SkillFocus.level()).modifyAll(level -> level + 1, team);
```

A `Collection` names no ordering and no uniqueness, so `collectionEach()` rebuilds whichever it was given. A set-valued `Collection` comes back a set, specifically a `LinkedHashSet`, so a `TreeSet` or other `SortedSet` source keeps its elements but not its ordering contract. Anything else comes back a `List`. A `Collection` that is neither, such as an `ArrayDeque`, also comes back a `List`; those types inherit identity `equals`, so no rebuild could return a collection equal to the one it was handed.

Every third-party *collection* generator goes through `EachInstances.fromIterableCollecting(collector)`, a generic factory that iterates the container, traverses the elements with the applicative, and rebuilds the container through the collector it is given; the map-shaped ones go through `mapValuesEachCollecting` instead. No extra HKJ module is needed: the library itself you supply, and a project that names one of these types in a record already has it on the classpath.

<!-- verify -->
```java
// Eclipse Collections, no manual wiring: the SPI generator supplies the Each instance
FocusPath<AssetClass, ImmutableList<Position>> positions = AssetClassFocus.positions();

TraversalPath<AssetClass, Position> eachPosition =
    positions.each(EachInstances.fromIterableCollecting(list -> Lists.immutable.ofAll(list)));

AssetClass rebalanced =
    eachPosition
        .via(PositionFocus.weight())
        .modifyAll(w -> w * 1.05, assetClass);
```

~~~admonish warning title="Raw and wildcard container type arguments"
Most containers widen by naming an optic **instance**: `.some(Affines.eitherRight())`, `.each(EachInstances.mapValuesEach())`. Javac works out that instance's own type arguments from the field's type. A raw container gives it nothing to work from, and a wildcard stands for no one type, so there is nothing to name. Rather than write a call that cannot compile, `@GenerateFocus` rejects the component:

<!-- verify:rejects "has a wildcard type argument" -->
```java
// Rejected: no Affine can be named for a wildcard type argument
@GenerateFocus
public record Holder(Either<String, ? extends Leaf> boundedEither) {}
```

<!-- verify -->
```java
// Accepted
@GenerateFocus
public record Holder(Either<String, Leaf> either) {}
```

Which fields the rule reaches follows from how each one widens:

| Field | Widens by | Raw or wildcard argument |
|-------|-----------|--------------------------|
| `Optional`, `Maybe`, `List` | `.some()` and `.each()`, which take no argument | ✅ Accepted. `List<? extends Leaf>` widens to `TraversalPath<Holder, Leaf>` |
| `Set`, `Collection` | naming an `Each` instance | ❌ Rejected, the same as an SPI container |
| `Either`, `Try`, `Validated`, `Map`, arrays, third-party collections | naming the optic its SPI generator supplies | ❌ Rejected, but only when the field is actually widened |
| `Kind<W, A>` | the `Traverse` registered for the witness `W` | ✅ Accepted. A wildcard element resolves to its bound, so `Kind<ListKind.Witness, ? extends Leaf>` widens to `TraversalPath<Holder, Leaf>`; a wildcard *witness* names no `Traverse` at all, so `Kind<?, Leaf>` stays a plain `FocusPath` (see [Kind Field Support](kind_field_support.md#convention-based-detection)) |

Three things narrow the rule further.

**Only the container's own type arguments count**, focused or not. `Either<?, Leaf>` is rejected even though the wildcard sits on the side the path never looks at. One level down is fine, because the container itself is still fully named: `Either<String, List<? extends Leaf>>` widens to `.some(Affines.eitherRight()).each()`.

**A `ZERO_OR_MORE` SPI container is only rejected when something widens it**, which means `widenCollections = true` or a navigator stepping into it. At the default settings the path stops at the container, no optic is named, and the wildcard costs nothing. That covers wildcards below it too: `Map<String, Either<String, ? extends Leaf>>` compiles at the default settings, because the `Map` is never widened and so the `Either` inside it is never asked for an optic.

**A generator that names no optic expression is exempt.** It widens through `.nullable()` or `.each()`, whose element type is free to be whatever the field says, so a raw or wildcard argument costs it nothing. Every generator shipped with HKJ names an optic, so this only applies to one of your own.

The rule follows the optic instance, so it is `@GenerateFocus`'s alone. `@GenerateTraversals` reads the same component and writes a `Traversal` over the type the wildcard stands for. Nothing is inferred there, so nothing can fail. See [Wildcard Element Types](traversals.md#wildcard-element-types).
~~~

### Cross-Ecosystem Navigation

Real projects mix collection libraries: JDK collections for ordinary code, Eclipse Collections for high-performance immutable data, HKJ types for typed error handling. Focus navigates all of them from one annotation, composing chains that cross ecosystem boundaries without ceremony.

## The fine print: registering your own container type

A library can teach the processor about its own container by implementing `TraversableGenerator`. The interface is small: say which types you handle, what cardinality they have, which type argument is the focus, what optic expression to emit, and (the one method with no default) how to emit `modifyF`.

```java
@ServiceProvider(TraversableGenerator.class)
public final class ResultGenerator extends BaseTraversableGenerator {

  @Override
  public boolean supports(TypeMirror type) {
    return type instanceof DeclaredType d && d.asElement().toString().equals("com.example.Result");
  }

  @Override
  public Cardinality getCardinality() {
    return Cardinality.ZERO_OR_ONE;   // Result holds zero or one success value
  }

  @Override
  public int getFocusTypeArgumentIndex() {
    return 1;                          // Result<E, A> focuses on A
  }

  @Override
  public String generateOpticExpression() {
    return "ResultAffines.success()";  // a Java expression returning an Affine
  }

  @Override
  public Set<String> getRequiredImports() {
    return Set.of("com.example.optics.ResultAffines");
  }

  @Override
  public CodeBlock generateModifyF(
      RecordComponentElement component,
      ClassName recordClassName,
      List<? extends RecordComponentElement> allComponents) {
    // The body of the generated Traversal.modifyF for this container.
    // EitherGenerator in hkj-processor-plugins is a worked implementation.
  }
}
```

`generateModifyF` is the only member without a default, so a generator that omits it will not compile: `BaseTraversableGenerator` supplies the generic-type and constructor-argument helpers, not this.

`@ServiceProvider` (from Avaje) writes the `META-INF/services` entry and checks the `module-info.java` `provides` clause for you. Once the generator is on the annotation processor path, any `@GenerateFocus` record with a `Result<E, A>` field generates an `AffinePath` that calls `.some(ResultAffines.success())`.

~~~admonish info title="Key Takeaways"
* **The field type picks the path type, through cardinality.** Zero or one gives an `AffinePath`, `List`/`Set`/`Collection` a `TraversalPath`, anything else a `FocusPath`. Every other zero-or-more container stops at the container until `widenCollections` says otherwise.
* **`List`, `Set`, `Collection` and `Optional` are built in.** Everything else, including `Map` and arrays, arrives through the `TraversableGenerator` SPI.
* **`widenCollections = true` removes the asymmetry.** Without it, an SPI `ZERO_OR_MORE` container stops at the container, in static Focus methods and navigator methods alike; a container holding a navigable element is stepped into either way, because that is how its navigator reaches the element.
* **Third-party collections need no extra HKJ module.** One generic `fromIterableCollecting` factory covers Eclipse Collections, Guava, Vavr, Apache Commons and PCollections, on top of the ecosystem dependency you already declare to name the type.
* **The SPI is open.** Implement `supports`, `getCardinality`, `getFocusTypeArgumentIndex`, `generateOpticExpression` and the one method with no default, `generateModifyF`; register with `@ServiceProvider`, and your container becomes a first-class Focus field.
