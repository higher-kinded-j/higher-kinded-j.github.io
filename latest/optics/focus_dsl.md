# Focus DSL: Path-Based Optic Syntax

_Navigate and update nested records through generated, compile-checked paths that mirror the shape of your data._

~~~admonish info title="What You'll Learn"
- Read, set and modify a field anywhere in your records through a generated path
- Predict the path type a field gives you, and spell the next hop
- Compose paths with `.via()` where a navigator does not reach
- Hand a path's optic to an API that takes a raw optic

A Focus path does for your records what the JPA metamodel or QueryDSL's Q-types do for a query, and it writes as well as reads. `UserFocus.address().city()` names a field the way `QUser.user.address.city` does, and the compiler checks every step. Instead of composing lenses, prisms and traversals by hand, you navigate your data with method chains that mirror its shape.

---

## The whole feature on one screen {#the-whole-feature-on-one-screen}

**Step 1.** Annotate two records:

``` java
@GenerateLenses
@GenerateFocus(generateNavigators = true)
record Address(String street, String city) {}

@GenerateLenses
@GenerateFocus(generateNavigators = true)
record User(String name, Address address) {}

```

**Step 2.** Use the generated `UserFocus` companion class:

``` java
    String city = UserFocus.address().city().get(alice);

    User moved = UserFocus.address().city().set("Paris", alice);

    User shouty = UserFocus.address().city().modify(String::toUpperCase, alice);
```

**Step 3.** That is it. The path you typed (`UserFocus.address().city()`) is a typed value: store it, pass it around, reuse it. The processor generated `UserFocus` and `AddressFocus` at compile time; nothing reflective happens at runtime.

`.city()` chains straight off `.address()` because of `generateNavigators = true`. A *navigator* is the small class the processor generates for a field whose type is another annotated record, with one method per field of that record. Without it, `UserFocus.address()` is still a perfectly good `FocusPath<User, Address>`, and you spell the next hop `.via(AddressFocus.city())`. Navigators are sugar over composition, so nothing is lost by leaving them off and nothing is locked in by turning them on.

Collections, optionals and sealed types extend the same pattern, and [Find your field](#find-your-field) gives the spelling for each. You almost never have to compose lenses by hand to get useful work done.

~~~admonish tip title="Why this matters"
The field's declared type decides the path type at compile time, so the path says how many values it can reach. An `Optional`, a `Maybe` or a field with a recognised `@Nullable` gives an `AffinePath`, never a `FocusPath` whose `get` quietly returns null. A `List`, `Set` or `Collection` gives a `TraversalPath`, which has no singular `get`. Mistakes of that shape are compilation errors, not production ones. The guarantee covers the shapes the processor recognises. A field that holds null without saying so gets a plain `FocusPath`, and so does a `Map` or an array unless the annotation sets `widenCollections = true`; [Find your field](#find-your-field) marks each.
~~~

## Find your field {#find-your-field}

You arrive holding a field, not an optic type. Find its declaration in the table: the row gives what the generated method returns and what you write next. Every row but the last is a component of the same `Order`, and the collapsed proof compiles each one. Each field links to the section that explains it.

| Your field | The generated method returns | What you write next |
|---|---|---|
| [`Customer customer`](focus_navigation.md#fluent-navigation-with-generated-navigators), a record with `@GenerateFocus` | a navigator, since `Order` has `generateNavigators = true` | `.email()` |
| `String reference` | `FocusPath<Order, String>` | `.get(order)`, `.set(value, order)`, `.modify(f, order)` |
| [`List<LineItem> lines`](focus_navigation.md#collection-navigation), or a `Set` or `Collection` | `TraversalPath<Order, LineItem>`, already on the elements | `.via(LineItemFocus.quantity())` |
| [`Optional<String> giftMessage`](focus_navigation.md#some-unwrap-optional) | `AffinePath<Order, String>` | `.getOptional(order)` |
| [`@Nullable String couponCode`](focus_navigation.md#nullable-handle-null-values), with a recognised `@Nullable` | `AffinePath<Order, String>` | `.getOptional(order)` |
| [`String legacyNote`](focus_navigation.md#nullable-handle-null-values), which may hold null but is not annotated | `FocusPath<Order, String>` | `.nullable()` |
| [`Map<String, String> attributes`](focus_navigation.md#access-by-index) | `FocusPath<Order, Map<String, String>>`, by default | `.atKey("channel")` |
| [`String[] tags`](focus_navigation.md#eacheach-traverse-with-a-custom-each-instance) | `FocusPath<Order, String[]>`, by default | `.each(EachInstances.arrayEach())` |
| [`Either<String, String> approvedBy`](focus_navigation.md#someaffine-navigate-spi-container-types), or a `Maybe`, `Try` or `Validated` | `AffinePath<Order, String>`, on the success side | `.getOptional(order)` |
| [`Payment payment`](focus_navigation.md#working-with-sum-types-using-instanceof), a sealed interface | `FocusPath<Order, Payment>` | `.via(PaymentPrisms.card())`, or `.via(AffinePath.instanceOf(Payment.Card.class))` |
| [`JsonNode payload`](importing_optics.md), a type you cannot annotate | `FocusPath<Order, JsonNode>` | `.via(JsonNodeOptics.object())`, from `@ImportOptics` |
| [`Kind<F, A> items`](kind_field_support.md) | a path chosen by the witness | depends on the witness |

The two rows marked "by default" step into the elements instead when the annotation sets `widenCollections = true`, which [the fine print](focus_navigation.md#path-widening) covers.

@GenerateFocus(generateNavigators = true)
record Customer(String name, String email) {}

    AffinePath<Order, String> giftMessage = OrderFocus.giftMessage();
    AffinePath<Order, String> couponCode = OrderFocus.couponCode();

    // A reference that may hold null, with no annotation: say so with .nullable()
    AffinePath<Order, String> legacyNote = OrderFocus.legacyNote().nullable();

    // A Map: the path focuses the whole map, and .atKey(k) picks one value
    AffinePath<Order, String> channel = OrderFocus.attributes().atKey("channel");

    // An array: the path focuses the whole array, and .each(...) steps into it
    TraversalPath<Order, String> tags = OrderFocus.tags().each(EachInstances.arrayEach());

    // An Either, Maybe, Try or Validated: zero or one, on the success side
    AffinePath<Order, String> approvedBy = OrderFocus.approvedBy();

    // A sealed type: a generated prism picks one variant, or instanceOf by runtime type
    AffinePath<Order, Payment.Card> card = OrderFocus.payment().via(PaymentPrisms.card());
    AffinePath<Order, Payment.Card> sameCard =
        OrderFocus.payment().via(AffinePath.instanceOf(Payment.Card.class));

    // A type you cannot annotate: compose the optics @ImportOptics generated for it
    AffinePath<Order, ObjectNode> payloadObject = OrderFocus.payload().via(JsonNodeOptics.object());
```

[Collections, Optionals and Sealed Types](focus_navigation.md) explains each row in depth: which fields get a navigator, and how a path widens as it goes.

## What the processor gives you {#what-the-processor-gives-you}

### Annotate the records {#annotate-the-records}

Add `@GenerateFocus` to generate path builders. The Focus class builds its own lenses, so `@GenerateFocus` alone compiles. Add `@GenerateLenses` as well in practice: several idioms in this chapter start from `FocusPath.of(TheseLenses.field())`, which needs the generated lens class. Indexing a list is one, and decomposing it into its head and tail with `ListPrisms` another.

``` java
@GenerateLenses
@GenerateFocus
record Company(String name, List<Department> departments) {}

@GenerateLenses
@GenerateFocus
record Department(String name, List<Employee> employees) {}

@GenerateLenses
@GenerateFocus
record Employee(String name, int age, Optional<String> email) {}

```

### One method per component, and the field type picks the path {#one-method-per-component-and-the-field-type-picks-the-path}

The generated companion has one method per record component, and the field's *type* decides the path type you get back:

``` java
    // A plain field: exactly one focus
    FocusPath<Company, String> namePath = CompanyFocus.name();
    String companyName = namePath.get(company);

    // A List field: the processor has already stepped into the elements
    TraversalPath<Company, Department> deptPath = CompanyFocus.departments();
    List<Department> allDepts = deptPath.getAll(company);

    // An Optional field: zero or one focus
    AffinePath<Employee, String> emailPath = EmployeeFocus.email();
    Optional<String> email = emailPath.getOptional(employee);
```

~~~admonish warning title="A collection field is already element-level"
`CompanyFocus.departments()` focuses each `Department`, not the `List<Department>`. That is what you want for bulk reads and updates, but it means an operation on the list as a whole, such as indexing into it or taking its head, does not compose onto it. When you need the list itself, start from the lens instead: `FocusPath.of(CompanyLenses.departments())`. See [Collections, Optionals and Sealed Types](focus_navigation.md#access-by-index) for the indexing forms.
~~~

### Chain with `.via()` {#chain-with-via}

Paths compose with `.via()`. Composing a path with a wider one widens the result, so one focus joined to many focuses is many focuses, and anything joined to a traversal is a traversal:

``` java
    TraversalPath<Company, String> allEmployeeNames =
        CompanyFocus.departments().via(DepartmentFocus.employees()).via(EmployeeFocus.name());

    // Read every one of them
    List<String> names = allEmployeeNames.getAll(company);

    // Or update every one of them
    Company updated = allEmployeeNames.modifyAll(String::toUpperCase, company);
```

## The Three Path Types

Focus DSL provides three path types, one for each answer to "how many values does this path reach?". Each navigation hop keeps the count or widens it, and `headOption()` is the one step back, from many to at most one:

| Path type | Reaches | After an optional step | After a collection step |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FocusPath<S, A>` | exactly one value | `AffinePath` | `TraversalPath` |
| `AffinePath<S, A>` | zero or one value | `AffinePath` | `TraversalPath` |
| `TraversalPath<S, A>` | zero or more values | `TraversalPath` | `TraversalPath` |

### FocusPath: Exactly One Element

`FocusPath<S, A>` wraps a `Lens<S, A>` and guarantees exactly one focused element:

``` java
    FocusPath<Employee, String> namePath = EmployeeFocus.name();

    String name = namePath.get(employee); // always a value
    Employee updated = namePath.set("Bob", employee); // always succeeds
    Employee modified = namePath.modify(String::toUpperCase, employee);
```

**Key Operations:**

| Method | Return Type | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `get(S)` | `A` | Extract the focused value |
| `set(A, S)` | `S` | Replace the focused value |
| `modify(Function<A,A>, S)` | `S` | Transform the focused value |
| `toLens()` | `Lens<S, A>` | Extract the underlying optic |

### AffinePath: Zero or One Element

`AffinePath<S, A>` wraps an `Affine<S, A>` for optional access:

``` java
    AffinePath<Employee, String> emailPath = EmployeeFocus.email();

    Optional<String> email = emailPath.getOptional(employee); // may be empty
    Employee updated = emailPath.set("new@example.com", employee); // writes even when absent
    Employee modified = emailPath.modify(String::toLowerCase, employee);
    boolean hasEmail = emailPath.matches(employee);
```

**Key Operations:**

| Method | Return Type | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `getOptional(S)` | `Optional<A>` | Extract if present |
| `set(A, S)` | `S` | Write the value, creating the focus when the last step can build it and every earlier step is present |
| `modify(Function<A,A>, S)` | `S` | Transform if present |
| `matches(S)` | `boolean` | Check whether a value is in focus |
| `getOrElse(A, S)` | `A` | Extract, or the given default |
| `toAffine()` | `Affine<S, A>` | Extract the underlying optic |

~~~admonish warning title="Set on an absent focus writes anyway"
`set` through an `AffinePath` is not conditional. `EmployeeFocus.email().set(x, employee)` on an employee with no email returns an employee *with* that email, because the last step's setter rebuilds the present case unconditionally. As `Affine.set`'s javadoc puts it, an affine makes an absent focus present when its last step can build the value and every step before that is present. `modify` is the operation that no-ops on an absent focus.

The rule is positional. A miss at the *last* step writes through and creates the focus when that step can build the value (a prism, `.some()`, `.nullable()`). A miss at an *earlier* step of a multi-step path skips the whole set, because `Affine.andThen(Affine)` does guard. When absence must be preserved, reach for `modify`, or test with `matches` first.
~~~

### TraversalPath: Zero or More Elements

`TraversalPath<S, A>` wraps a `Traversal<S, A>` for collection access:

``` java
    TraversalPath<Department, Employee> employeesPath = DepartmentFocus.employees();

    List<Employee> all = employeesPath.getAll(department);
    Department updated = employeesPath.setAll(replacement, department);
    Department modified =
        employeesPath.modifyAll(
            employee -> EmployeeLenses.age().modify(age -> age + 1, employee), department);
    int headcount = employeesPath.count(department);
```

**Key Operations:**

| Method | Return Type | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `getAll(S)` | `List<A>` | Extract all focused values |
| `setAll(A, S)` | `S` | Replace all focused values |
| `modifyAll(Function<A,A>, S)` | `S` | Transform all focused values |
| `filter(Predicate<A>)` | `TraversalPath<S, A>` | Narrow to the matching elements (on a raw `Traversal` the same narrowing is spelled `filtered`) |
| `preview(S)` | `Optional<A>` | The first focused value, if there is one and it is not null |
| `count(S)`, `isEmpty(S)` | `int`, `boolean` | Query the number in focus |
| `exists(Predicate<A>, S)`, `all(Predicate<A>, S)` | `boolean` | Does any, or every, focused value match |
| `find(Predicate<A>, S)` | `Optional<A>` | The first focused value that matches and is not null |
| `fold(Monoid<A>, S)` | `A` | Combine every focused value through a monoid |
| `headOption()` | `AffinePath<S, A>` | Narrow to the first focused element (reads the first, writes to all) |
| `toTraversal()` | `Traversal<S, A>` | Extract the underlying optic |

~~~admonish info title="Key Takeaways"
* **The field type picks the path type.** A plain field gives `FocusPath`, an `Optional` field gives `AffinePath`, a `List` or `Set` field gives `TraversalPath` already stepped into the elements.
* **`.via()` is the universal join.** Navigators are generated sugar for a subset of fields; everything else composes with `.via()`, and the two mix freely. [Collections, Optionals and Sealed Types](focus_navigation.md) sets out which fields qualify.
* **Composing widens.** Composing a path with a wider one widens the result: one focus plus zero-or-one is zero-or-one, and anything joined to a traversal is a traversal. `headOption()` is the one step back.
* **A path is a value, not a call.** Build it once, store it in a static field, pass it around. `toLens()`, `toAffine()` and `toTraversal()` hand the underlying optic to any API that wants a raw optic.
