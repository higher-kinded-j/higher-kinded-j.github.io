The Focus DSL provides a fluent, path-based syntax for working with optics. Instead of composing lenses, prisms, and traversals by hand, you navigate your data structures with method chains that mirror the shape of the data.

## The Whole Feature on One Screen

If you only have a few minutes, this is the entire feature.

**Step 1.** Annotate two records:

<!-- verify -->
```java
import org.higherkindedj.optics.annotations.GenerateFocus;

@GenerateFocus(generateNavigators = true)
record Address(String street, String city) {}

@GenerateFocus(generateNavigators = true)
record User(String name, Address address) {}
```

**Step 2.** Use the generated `UserFocus` companion class:

<!-- verify -->
```java
// Get
String city = UserFocus.address().city().get(alice);              // "London"

// Set
User moved = UserFocus.address().city().set("Paris", alice);

// Modify
User shouty = UserFocus.address().city().modify(String::toUpperCase, alice);
```

**Step 3.** That is it. The path you typed (`UserFocus.address().city()`) is a typed value: store it, pass it around, reuse it. The processor generated `UserFocus` and `AddressFocus` at compile time; nothing reflective happens at runtime.

Collections, optionals and sealed types extend the same pattern through `.each()`, `.some()`, `.at(i)` and `instanceOf()`. A `Kind<F, A>` field needs none of them: the processor recognises the witness and generates the traversal, which [Kind Field Support](kind_field_support.md) covers. The rest of this page walks through the path types; you almost never have to compose lenses by hand to get useful work done.

~~~admonish tip title="Why this matters"
`generateNavigators = true` is what makes `.city()` chain directly off `.address()`. Without it, `UserFocus.address()` is still a perfectly good `FocusPath<User, Address>`; you just spell the next hop `.via(AddressFocus.city())`. Navigators are sugar over composition, not a separate mechanism, so nothing is lost by leaving them off and nothing is locked in by turning them on.

## The Problem: Verbose Manual Composition

Deep updates without optics mean rebuilding every record on the way down. With raw optics they mean composing at each use site:

```java
// Manual composition: verbose and repetitive
Traversal<Company, String> employeeNames =
    CompanyTraversals.departments()
        .andThen(DepartmentTraversals.employees())
        .andThen(EmployeeLenses.name());

List<String> names = Traversals.getAll(employeeNames, company);
```

With the Focus DSL the same navigation reads as a path, and the path type tracks how many elements are in focus:

<!-- verify -->
```java
List<String> names =
    CompanyFocus.departments()          // TraversalPath<Company, Department>
        .via(DepartmentFocus.employees()) // TraversalPath<Company, Employee>
        .via(EmployeeFocus.name())        // TraversalPath<Company, String>
        .getAll(company);
```

---

## Think of Focus Paths Like...

- **File system paths**: `/company/departments/employees/name`
- **JSONPath**: `$.departments[*].employees[*].name`
- **XPath expressions**: `//department/employee/name`
- **IDE navigation**: click through nested fields with autocomplete

The key difference: Focus paths are fully type-safe, with compile-time checking at every step.

## What the Processor Gives You

### Annotate the records

Add `@GenerateFocus` to generate path builders. The Focus class builds its own lenses, so `@GenerateFocus` alone compiles. Add `@GenerateLenses` as well in practice: several idioms in this chapter (indexing a list, composing `ListPrisms`, acting on a collection as a whole) start from `FocusPath.of(TheseLenses.field())`, which needs the generated lens class.

```java
import org.higherkindedj.optics.annotations.GenerateFocus;
import org.higherkindedj.optics.annotations.GenerateLenses;

@GenerateLenses
@GenerateFocus
public record Company(String name, List<Department> departments) {}

@GenerateLenses
@GenerateFocus
public record Department(String name, List<Employee> employees) {}

@GenerateLenses
@GenerateFocus
public record Employee(String name, int age, Optional<String> email) {}
```

### One method per component, and the field type picks the path

The generated companion has one method per record component, and the field's *type* decides the path type you get back:

<!-- verify -->
```java
// A plain field: exactly one focus
FocusPath<Company, String> namePath = CompanyFocus.name();
String companyName = namePath.get(company);

// A List field: the processor has already stepped into the elements
TraversalPath<Company, Department> deptPath = CompanyFocus.departments();
List<Department> allDepts = deptPath.getAll(company);

// An Optional field: zero or one focus
AffinePath<Employee, String> emailPath = EmployeeFocus.email();
Optional<String> email = emailPath.getOptional(employee);
```

~~~admonish warning title="A collection field is already element-level"
`CompanyFocus.departments()` focuses each `Department`, not the `List<Department>`. That is what you want for bulk reads and updates, but it means list-level operations (`ListPrisms.head()`, indexing into the list) do not compose onto it. When you need the list itself, start from the lens instead: `FocusPath.of(CompanyLenses.departments())`. See [Navigation and Composition](focus_navigation.md#access-by-index) for the indexing forms.
~~~

### Chain with `.via()`

Paths compose with `.via()`. Composing a path with a wider one widens the result, so one focus joined to many focuses is many focuses, and anything joined to a traversal is a traversal:

<!-- verify -->
```java
TraversalPath<Company, String> allEmployeeNames =
    CompanyFocus.departments()
        .via(DepartmentFocus.employees())
        .via(EmployeeFocus.name());

// Read every one of them
List<String> names = allEmployeeNames.getAll(company);

// Or update every one of them
Company updated = allEmployeeNames.modifyAll(String::toUpperCase, company);
```

## The Three Path Types

Focus DSL provides three path types, one for each answer to "how many values does this path reach?". Each navigation hop keeps the count or widens it, and `headOption()` is the one step back, from many to at most one:

| Path type | Reaches | After an optional step | After a collection step |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FocusPath<S, A>` | exactly one value | `AffinePath` | `TraversalPath` |
| `AffinePath<S, A>` | zero or one value | `AffinePath` | `TraversalPath` |
| `TraversalPath<S, A>` | zero or more values | `TraversalPath` | `TraversalPath` |

### FocusPath: Exactly One Element

`FocusPath<S, A>` wraps a `Lens<S, A>` and guarantees exactly one focused element:

<!-- verify -->
```java
FocusPath<Employee, String> namePath = EmployeeFocus.name();

String name = namePath.get(employee);                            // always a value
Employee updated = namePath.set("Bob", employee);                // always succeeds
Employee modified = namePath.modify(String::toUpperCase, employee);
```

**Key Operations:**

| Method | Return Type | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `get(S)` | `A` | Extract the focused value |
| `set(A, S)` | `S` | Replace the focused value |
| `modify(Function<A,A>, S)` | `S` | Transform the focused value |
| `toLens()` | `Lens<S, A>` | Extract the underlying optic |

### AffinePath: Zero or One Element

`AffinePath<S, A>` wraps an `Affine<S, A>` for optional access:

<!-- verify -->
```java
AffinePath<Employee, String> emailPath = EmployeeFocus.email();

Optional<String> email = emailPath.getOptional(employee);        // may be empty
Employee updated = emailPath.set("new@email.com", employee);     // writes anyway: creates the email if absent
Employee modified = emailPath.modify(String::toLowerCase, employee);
boolean hasEmail = emailPath.matches(employee);
```

**Key Operations:**

| Method | Return Type | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `getOptional(S)` | `Optional<A>` | Extract if present |
| `set(A, S)` | `S` | Write the value, creating the focus when the last step can build it and every earlier step is present |
| `modify(Function<A,A>, S)` | `S` | Transform if present |
| `matches(S)` | `boolean` | Check whether a value is in focus |
| `getOrElse(A, S)` | `A` | Extract, or the given default |
| `toAffine()` | `Affine<S, A>` | Extract the underlying optic |

~~~admonish warning title="Set on an absent focus writes anyway"
`set` through an `AffinePath` is not conditional. `EmployeeFocus.email().set(x, employee)` on an employee with no email returns an employee *with* that email, because the last step's setter rebuilds the present case unconditionally. As `Affine.set`'s javadoc puts it, an affine makes an absent focus present when its last step can build the value and every step before that is present. `modify` is the operation that no-ops on an absent focus.

The rule is positional. A miss at the *last* step writes through and creates the focus when that step can build the value (a prism, `.some()`, `.nullable()`). A miss at an *earlier* step of a multi-step path skips the whole set, because `Affine.andThen(Affine)` does guard. When absence must be preserved, reach for `modify`, or test with `matches` first.
~~~

### TraversalPath: Zero or More Elements

`TraversalPath<S, A>` wraps a `Traversal<S, A>` for collection access:

<!-- verify -->
```java
TraversalPath<Department, Employee> employeesPath = DepartmentFocus.employees();

List<Employee> all = employeesPath.getAll(department);
Department updated = employeesPath.setAll(employee, department);
Department modified = employeesPath.modifyAll(Fixture::promote, department);
int headcount = employeesPath.count(department);
```

`Fixture`, here and throughout this chapter, is the compiled example's own setup: sample records, hand-written optics and validators. Nothing in it is library API.

**Key Operations:**

| Method | Return Type | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `getAll(S)` | `List<A>` | Extract all focused values |
| `setAll(A, S)` | `S` | Replace all focused values |
| `modifyAll(Function<A,A>, S)` | `S` | Transform all focused values |
| `filter(Predicate<A>)` | `TraversalPath<S, A>` | Narrow to the matching elements (on a raw `Traversal` the same narrowing is spelled `filtered`) |
| `preview(S)` | `Optional<A>` | The first focused value, if there is one and it is not null |
| `count(S)`, `isEmpty(S)` | `int`, `boolean` | Query the number in focus |
| `exists(Predicate<A>, S)`, `all(Predicate<A>, S)` | `boolean` | Does any, or every, focused value match |
| `find(Predicate<A>, S)` | `Optional<A>` | The first focused value that matches and is not null |
| `fold(Monoid<A>, S)` | `A` | Combine every focused value through a monoid |
| `headOption()` | `AffinePath<S, A>` | Narrow to the first focused element (reads the first, writes to all) |
| `toTraversal()` | `Traversal<S, A>` | Extract the underlying optic |

~~~admonish info title="Key Takeaways"
* **The field type picks the path type.** A plain field gives `FocusPath`, an `Optional` field gives `AffinePath`, a `List` or `Set` field gives `TraversalPath` already stepped into the elements.
* **`.via()` is the universal join.** Navigators are generated sugar for a subset of fields; everything else composes with `.via()`, and the two mix freely. [Navigation and Composition](focus_navigation.md) sets out which fields qualify.
* **Widening is one-directional.** Composing a path with a wider one widens the result: one focus plus zero-or-one is zero-or-one, and anything joined to a traversal is a traversal.
* **A path is a value, not a call.** Build it once, store it in a static field, pass it around. `toLens()`, `toAffine()` and `toTraversal()` hand the underlying optic to any API that wants a raw optic.
