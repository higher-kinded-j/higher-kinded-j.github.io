As Java developers, we appreciate the safety and predictability of immutable objects, especially with the introduction of records. However, this safety comes at a cost: updating nested immutable data is verbose and error-prone.

Consider a simple nested record structure:

<!-- verify -->
```java
record Street(String name, int number) {}
record Address(Street street, String city) {}
record User(String name, Address address) {}
```

How do you update the user's street name? In standard Java, you're forced into a "copy-and-update" cascade:

<!-- verify -->
```java
// What most Java developers actually write
public User updateStreetName(User user, String newStreetName) {
    var address = user.address();
    var street = address.street();
    var newStreet = new Street(newStreetName, street.number());
    var newAddress = new Address(newStreet, address.city());
    return new User(user.name(), newAddress);
}
```

This is tedious, hard to read, and grows by another rebuild with every level of nesting. What if there was a way to "zoom in" on the data you want to change, update it, and get a new copy of the top-level object back, all in one clean operation?

This is the problem that **Optics** solve.

## The Core Idea

At their core, optics are simply **composable, functional getters and setters** for immutable data structures.

Think of an optic as a *zoom lens* for your data. It's a first-class object that represents a path from a whole structure (like `User`) to a specific part (like the street `name`). Because it's an object, you can pass it around, compose it with other optics, and use it to perform functional updates.

## Think of Optics Like...

* **Lens**: A magnifying glass that focuses on one specific part
* **Prism**: A tool that splits light, but only works with certain types of light
* **Affine**: A magnifying glass for a slot that may be empty
* **Iso**: A universal translator between equivalent languages
* **Traversal**: A spotlight that can illuminate many targets at once
* **Fold**: A read-only query tool that extracts and aggregates data

Every optic answers two questions about a structure `S` and a part `A` inside it:

1. **How many parts does it reach?** A Lens or an Iso reaches exactly one, a Prism or an Affine zero or one, and a Traversal or a Fold any number. Each reads accordingly: with `get`, with `getOptional`, or as a list of them all.
2. **Can it write?** Lens, Prism, Affine, Iso and Traversal can: give them new parts and you get back a new `S` with those parts updated. A write never mutates; a new copy of `S` is returned. The read-only `Fold` and `Getter` are the exceptions: they query but never write.

The real power comes from their **composability**. You can chain optics together to peer deeply into nested structures and perform targeted updates with ease.

## The Optics Family in Higher-Kinded-J

Higher-Kinded-J builds its optics around six core types, each designed for a specific kind of data access problem. Two specialists complete the family of eight that the [chapter introduction](ch_intro.md#how-the-optic-types-relate) draws: the read-only Getter and the write-only Setter, covered in [Collections](ch2_intro.md).

### 1. Lens: For "Has-A" Relationships

A **Lens** is the most common optic. It focuses on a single, required piece of data within a larger "product type" (a `record` or class with fields). It's for data that is guaranteed to exist.

* **Problem it solves**: Getting and setting a field within an object, especially a deeply nested one.
* **Generated Code**: Annotating a record with `@GenerateLenses` produces a companion class (e.g., `UserLenses`) that contains:

  1. A **lens** for each field (e.g., `UserLenses.address()`).
  2. Convenient **`with*` helper methods** for easy updates (e.g., `UserLenses.withAddress(...)`).
* **Example (Deep Update with Lenses)**:

  * To solve our initial problem of updating the user's street name (the same path the chapter opened with), we compose lenses:

<!-- verify -->
```java
    // Compose lenses to create a direct path to the nested data
    var userToStreetName = UserLenses.address()
        .andThen(AddressLenses.street())
        .andThen(StreetLenses.name());
  
    // Perform the deep update in a single, readable line
    User updatedUser = userToStreetName.set("New Street", user);
```

* **Example (Shallow Update with `with*` Helpers)**:

  * For simple, top-level updates, the `with*` methods are more direct and discoverable.

<!-- verify -->
```java
// Before: Using the lens directly
User userWithNewName = UserLenses.name().set("Bob", user);

// After: Using the generated helper method
User renamedUser = UserLenses.withName(user, "Bob");
```

### 2. Iso: For "Is-Equivalent-To" Relationships

An **Iso** (Isomorphism) is a special, reversible optic. It represents a lossless, two-way conversion between two types that hold the exact same information. Think of it as a type-safe, composable adapter.

* **Problem it solves**: Swapping between different representations of the same data, such as a wrapper class and its raw value, or between two structurally different but informationally equivalent records.
* **Example**: Suppose you have a `Point` record and a `Tuple2<Integer, Integer>`, which are structurally different but hold the same data.

<!-- verify -->
  ```java
  public record Point(int x, int y) {}
  ```

  You can define an `Iso` to convert between them:

<!-- verify -->
  ```java
  @GenerateIsos
  public static Iso<Point, Tuple2<Integer, Integer>> pointToTuple() {
    return Iso.of(
        point -> Tuple.of(point.x(), point.y()), // get
        tuple -> new Point(tuple._1(), tuple._2())  // reverseGet
    );
  }
  ```

  This `Iso` can now be composed with other optics to, for example, create a `Lens` that goes from a `Point` directly to its first element inside a `Tuple` representation.

### 3. Prism: For "Is-A" Relationships

A **Prism** is like a Lens, but for "sum types" (`sealed interface` or `enum`). It focuses on a single, *possible case* of a type. A Prism's `get` operation can fail (it returns an `Optional`), because the data might not be the case you're looking for. Think of it as a type-safe, functional `instanceof` and cast.

* **Problem it solves**: Safely operating on one variant of a sealed interface.
* **Example**: Instead of using an `if-instanceof` chain to handle a specific `DomainError`:

<!-- verify -->
```java
// Using a generated Prism for a sealed interface
DomainErrorPrisms.shippingError()
   .getOptional(error) // Safely gets a ShippingError if it matches
   .filter(ShippingError::isRecoverable)
   .ifPresent(this::handleRecovery); // Perform action only if it's the right type
```

### 4. Affine: For "Might-Be-There" Relationships

An **Affine** focuses on **zero or one** value: an optional field, a nullable property, or any path where the target may be absent but can never occur twice. It behaves like a Lens whose focus is not guaranteed, and it is exactly what you get when you compose a Lens with a Prism.

* **Problem it solves**: Safely reading and updating a value inside an `Optional` field without unwrapping it by hand.
* **Example**: To reach a phone number stored as `Optional<String>`:

<!-- verify -->
```java
@GenerateLenses
record ContactInfo(String email, Optional<String> phone) {}

ContactInfo contact = new ContactInfo("ada@example.com", Optional.of("020 7946 0958"));

// Lens into the Optional field, then Affines.some() into its content
Affine<ContactInfo, String> contactToPhone =
    ContactInfoLenses.phone().andThen(Affines.some());

Optional<String> phone = contactToPhone.getOptional(contact);       // empty when absent
ContactInfo updated = contactToPhone.modify(String::trim, contact); // no-op when absent
```

### 5. Traversal: For "Has-Many" Relationships

A **Traversal** is an optic that can focus on multiple targets at once, typically all the items within a collection inside a larger structure.

* **Problem it solves**: Applying an operation to every element in a `List`, `Set`, or other collection that is a field within an object.
* **Example**: To validate every promo code in an order, collecting every bad one rather than stopping at the first:

  <!-- verify -->
  ```java
  @GenerateTraversals
  record OrderData(String id, List<String> promoCodes) {}

  Function<String, Validated<String, String>> checkCode = code ->
      code.matches("[A-Z0-9]{6}")
          ? Validated.valid(code)
          : Validated.invalid("not a promo code: " + code);

  // Every invalid code is reported, in order; an all-valid order comes back unchanged.
  Validated<List<String>, OrderData> result =
      OpticOps.modifyAllValidated(orderData, OrderDataTraversals.promoCodes(), checkCode);
  ```

### 6. Fold: For "Has-Many" Queries

A **Fold** is a read-only optic designed specifically for querying and extracting data without modification. Think of it as a `Traversal` that has given up the ability to modify in exchange for a clearer expression of intent and additional query-focused operations.

* **Problem it solves**: Extracting information from complex data structures: finding items, checking conditions, aggregating values, or collecting data without modifying the original structure.
* **Generated Code**: Annotating a record with `@GenerateFolds` produces a companion class (e.g., `OrderFolds`) with a `Fold` for each field.
* **Example (Querying Product Catalogue)**:

  * To find all products in an order that cost more than £50:

<!-- verify -->
```java
    // Get the generated fold
    Fold<Order, Product> orderToProducts = OrderFolds.items();

    // Find all matching products
    List<Product> expensiveItems = orderToProducts.getAll(order).stream()
        .filter(product -> product.price() > 50.00)
        .collect(toList());

    // Or check if any exist
    boolean hasExpensiveItems = orderToProducts.exists(
        product -> product.price() > 50.00,
        order
    );
```

* **Key Operations**:
  * `getAll(source)`: Extract all focused values into a `List`
  * `preview(source)`: Get the first value as an `Optional`
  * `find(predicate, source)`: Find first matching value
  * `exists(predicate, source)`: Check if any value matches
  * `all(predicate, source)`: Check if all values match
  * `isEmpty(source)`: Check if there are zero focused values
  * `length(source)`: Count the number of focused values

**Why Fold is Important**: While `Traversal` can do everything `Fold` can do, using `Fold` makes your code's intent crystal clear: "I'm only reading this data, not modifying it." This is valuable for code reviewers, for preventing accidental mutations, and for expressing domain logic where queries should be separated from commands ([CQRS pattern](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html)).

## Advanced Capabilities: Profunctor Adaptations

Every optic is fundamentally an `Optic<S, T, A, B>`, and that interface carries the **profunctor** operations `contramap`, `map`, and `dimap`, which adapt the types an optic works between: where it reads from, and what an update produces.

In practice most adaptation is done by composing (when the new source contains the old) or by bridging through an [Iso](iso.md) (when two shapes hold the same information), both of which keep the full optic API. The raw profunctor operations return an `Optic`, and come into their own in effectful `modifyF` pipelines. The [Profunctor Optics Guide](profunctor_optics.md) works through which route fits which job.

## How `higher-kinded-j` Provides Optics

This brings us to the unique advantages `higher-kinded-j` offers for optics in Java.

1. **An Annotation-Driven Workflow**: Manually writing optics is boilerplate. The `higher-kinded-j` approach automates this. By simply adding an annotation (`@GenerateLenses`, `@GeneratePrisms`, etc.) to your data classes, you get fully-functional, type-safe optics for free. That removes the boilerplate that keeps most Java code away from optics.
2. **Higher-Kinded Types for Effectful Updates**: Because `higher-kinded-j` provides an HKT abstraction (`Kind<F, A>`) and type classes like `Functor` and `Applicative`, the optics can perform *effectful* modifications. The `modifyF` method is generic over an `Applicative` effect `F`. This means you can perform an update within the context of any data type that has an `Applicative` instance:
   * Want to perform an update that might fail? Use `Optional` or `Either` as your `F`.
   * Want to perform an asynchronous update? Use `CompletableFuture` as your `F`.
   * Want to accumulate validation errors? Use `Validated` as your `F`.
3. **Adaptable to other types**: an optic can be adapted with `contramap`, `map` and `dimap` to work over different source and target types, which helps when integrating with external systems, legacy data formats and strongly-typed wrappers.

## Common Patterns

### When to Use `with*` Helpers vs Manual Lenses

* **Use `with*` helpers** for simple, top-level field updates
* **Use composed lenses** for deep updates or when you need to reuse the path
* **Use manual lens creation** for a type you cannot annotate, and test it with `LensLaws`: see [Use Manual Lens Creation When](lenses.md#use-manual-lens-creation-when)

### Decision Guide

The [first decision tree](decision_trees.md#tree-1-which-optic-do-i-need) routes the core choices; two further tools complete the family:

* **Need to query or extract data without modification?** → **Fold**
* **Need to adapt existing optics to other types?** → **Profunctor operations**

## Common Pitfalls

**Don't do this:**

<!-- verify -->
```java
// Get-then-set repeats the path and leaves a gap between the read and the write
var street = userToStreetName.get(user);
var updatedUser = userToStreetName.set(street.toUpperCase(), user);
```

**Do this instead:**

<!-- verify -->
```java
// Use modify() for transformations
var updatedUser = userToStreetName.modify(String::toUpperCase, user);
```

~~~admonish info title="Key Takeaways"
* **Optics are composable, reusable paths**: first-class getter/setter objects you chain with `andThen` to reach any depth, replacing the copy-and-update cascade
* **Six core types, one decision**: Lens (always there), Prism (might match), Affine (might be there), Iso (same information, different shape), Traversal (many targets), Fold (read-only queries)
* **The annotations write the boilerplate**: `@GenerateLenses`, `@GeneratePrisms`, `@GenerateIsos`, `@GenerateTraversals`, and `@GenerateFolds` keep the optics in sync with your records
* **`modifyF` makes any settable path effect-ready**: failable, accumulating, or asynchronous updates through the same optic; [Lenses](lenses.md) shows it in action
