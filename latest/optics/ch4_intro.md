Optics originated in Haskell, a language with rather different conventions to Java. Method names like `view`, `over`, and `preview` do not match what Java developers expect, and the parameter ordering (value before source) feels backwards to anyone accustomed to the receiver-first style.

This chapter closes that gap. Here is the destination, before any theory: a deep read and a bulk update over a company graph, written the way a Java developer would want to write them. Every line compiles against the real library and the real annotation processor on every build:

<!-- verify -->
```java
// Company -> headquarters -> city: a single field access, generated
String hq = CompanyFocus.headquarters().city().get(acme);
// "London"

// Company -> departments[] -> staff[] -> salary: every salary, in one expression
Company afterRise =
    CompanyFocus.departments()
        .via(DepartmentFocus.staff())
        .via(EmployeeFocus.salary())
        .modifyAll(s -> s.multiply(new BigDecimal("1.10")), acme);
// every salary is 10% higher; acme itself is untouched
```

No casting, no null checks, no loops, and no `Optional` gymnastics. Both paths are generated from four annotated records by `@GenerateFocus(generateNavigators = true)`: `Company(name, headquarters, departments)`, `Department(name, staff)`, `Employee(name, salary)` and an `Address` with a `city`. The pages that follow shape their own models to the point they are making, so read the field names from each page rather than carrying these forward.

~~~admonish tip title="Why this matters"
That chain is not a string, a reflective path expression, or a runtime lookup. `headquarters()`, `city()`, `staff()` and `salary()` are ordinary methods generated at compile time, so a renamed field is a compilation error rather than a `NullPointerException` in production, and the IDE autocompletes each step. It is also a *value*: store the path in a static field, pass it to a method, reuse it. The chain reads like a field access and behaves like an optic.
~~~

The two lines differ for a reason worth knowing early. `headquarters` is a plain field whose type is itself annotated, so the processor generates a *navigator* and `.city()` chains straight off it. `departments` is a `List`, which the processor already unwraps to a `TraversalPath` over the elements, so the next hop is spelled `.via(...)`. [Navigation and Composition](focus_navigation.md#fluent-navigation-with-generated-navigators) sets out exactly which fields get which.

## Which API Should I Use?

Three APIs sit on the same optics. Pick by what the operation has to do, not by taste:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Q{"What does the<br/>operation need to do?"}
    Q -->|"read or update a value<br/>somewhere in the structure"| F(["Focus DSL<br/>start here"])
    Q -->|"the update can fail,<br/>accumulate errors, or run async"| O(["Fluent API<br/>OpticOps"])
    Q -->|"record the plan first:<br/>audit, dry-run, replay"| R(["Free Monad DSL<br/>Advanced Optics"])

    classDef decision fill:#e5c890,stroke:#df8e1d,color:#232634
    classDef tier fill:#a6d189,stroke:#40a02b,color:#232634
    class Q decision
    class F,O,R tier
```

They compose rather than compete: a Focus path hands its underlying optic to `OpticOps` through `toLens()`, `toAffine()` or `toTraversal()`, so choosing one first never locks the others out.

**Focus DSL** is path-based navigation that mirrors the shape of the data. `@GenerateFocus` generates the path builders; `.each()`, `.some()`, `.at(i)` and `instanceOf()` extend them through collections, optionals and sealed types.

**Fluent API** is `OpticOps`: static methods and builders for operations that involve validation or effects, including four dedicated validation methods that would otherwise mean wiring an `Applicative` by hand.

**Free Monad DSL** builds optic programs you can interpret more than one way, for when the interesting artefact is the *plan* rather than the result. It lives in [Advanced Optics](ch6_intro.md).

~~~admonish info title="In This Chapter"
- **Focus DSL** – The recommended starting point, replacing manual lens composition with fluent, path-based navigation. The compiler tracks every step, so the IDE can autocomplete the full path through your data.
- **Optics for External Types** – Generate optics for types you do not own (Jackson, JOOQ, Lombok, JDK classes) using `@ImportOptics` for shapes the processor can analyse directly. When a type resists auto-detection, an interface extending `OpticsSpec<S>` lets you declare each optic and tell the processor how to build it: `@InstanceOf` and `@MatchWhen` for prisms, `@ViaBuilder`, `@Wither`, `@ViaConstructor` and `@ViaCopyAndSet` for lenses.
- **Focus DSL with External Libraries** – Focus navigation stops at the boundary of the types you own. `.via()` carries it across into Immutables, Lombok, AutoValue and Protobuf values, so a path can run from your record into a library's value object without a helper method per field.
- **Kind Field Support** – A record field typed `Kind<F, A>` needs no annotation at all: the processor recognises the library witnesses by name, applies the right `Traverse`, and picks the path type from the witness's cardinality. `@TraverseField` covers the witnesses it does not know.
- **Fluent API** – When a modification can fail, accumulates errors, or runs asynchronously, `OpticOps` is the right tool. Static methods cover one-off cases; the fluent builders give you discoverable chaining for composing with `Either`, `Maybe`, `Validated`, and any other `Applicative`.
