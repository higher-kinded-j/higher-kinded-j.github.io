The [Focus DSL](focus_dsl.md) and [Collections, Optionals and Sealed Types](focus_navigation.md) cover the paths most code needs. This group covers what those pages leave out: running a path under an effect, containers the processor does not know, and record fields typed `Kind<F, A>`. It also has the prisms and extension methods that join optics to the library's core types. Read a page when one of those comes up, and skip the group until then. As a reminder of where the everyday pages left off, here are a deep read and a bulk update over the chapter's order, where `Order` and `Customer` carry `@GenerateFocus(generateNavigators = true)`. The build compiles and runs it, and a test holds each value the comments show:

``` java
    // Order -> customer -> email -> value: chained hops, generated
    String email = OrderFocus.customer().email().value().get(order);
    // "ada@example.com"

    // Order -> lines[] -> price: every price, in one expression
    Order afterRise =
        OrderFocus.lines()
            .via(LineItemFocus.price())
            .modifyAll(price -> price.multiply(new BigDecimal("1.10")), order);
    // every price is 10% higher; order itself is untouched
```

~~~admonish tip title="Why this matters"
That chain is not a string, a reflective path expression, or a runtime lookup. `customer()`, `email()`, `lines()` and `price()` are ordinary methods generated at compile time, so a renamed field is a compilation error rather than a `NullPointerException` in production, and the IDE autocompletes each step. It is also a *value*: store the path in a static field, pass it to a method, reuse it. The chain reads like a field access and behaves like an optic.
~~~

`customer` chains `.email()` straight off a generated *navigator*, while `lines` is a `List`, which the processor unwraps to a `TraversalPath` over its elements, so its next hop is spelled `.via(...)`. [Collections, Optionals and Sealed Types](focus_navigation.md#fluent-navigation-with-generated-navigators) sets out which fields get which. A path hands its underlying optic to `OpticOps` through `toLens()`, `toAffine()` or `toTraversal()`, so starting with the Focus DSL never locks the other APIs out.
