# Production Readiness

_What optics cost at run time and build time, and the conventions that keep a team consistent._

This page does not offer a marketing case for using optics in production; it offers honest answers to the questions a senior engineer asks before adopting a new abstraction in a codebase others must maintain.

---

## Runtime cost

### What `set` and `modify` allocate

Every `set` or `modify` call on a `Lens` over a record allocates one new record per layer of nesting touched. A composed lens through three layers allocates three new records, plus any intermediate captures. There is no in-place mutation; that is the cost of immutability and not specific to optics.

Compared to a hand-written `with*` cascade for the same nested update, generated optics typically incur the same allocation count. The difference is the two or three anonymous `Lens` and `FocusPath` objects the composition allocates.

For a single update on a small record, the cost is unlikely to matter. For tight inner loops, see the caching note below.

These are engineering estimates from the shape of the generated code, not benchmark output: the [JMH suite](../benchmarks.md) covers `Fold.plus` but not lens or traversal allocation.

### `modifyF` and effect handlers

`modifyF(f, source, applicative)` runs `f` once per focused element and threads the results through the supplied `Applicative`. The cost is one call to `f` plus whatever the applicative's `ap` and `pure` do. `Validated` accumulates every error and `Either` keeps only the first, but neither skips work: the traversal applies `f` to every focused element before the applicative combines the results, so the choice shapes the answer rather than the cost.

### Traversal allocation

`Traversals.modify(traversal, f, source)` over a `List<A>` allocates one new list, plus a small constant number of short-lived objects *per element*: the traversal threads each result through the `Id` applicative and an immutable cons-list before flattening. Budget O(n) allocations, not O(1). (Reads and writes on a bare `Traversal` go through the `Traversals` utility; the interface itself declares no plain read or write.) If the function returns the same value for every element (a no-op modify), the list is still rebuilt; optics do not compare references to skip rebuilding.

## Caching optics

A lens or focus path is a value, not a function. Building the path has a one-off allocation cost, which caching removes; applying it still allocates the rebuilt structure, which nothing removes. For paths used repeatedly, store them as `static final`:

```java
private static final Lens<Company, String> COMPANY_NAME =
    CompanyLenses.name();

private static final TraversalPath<Order, BigDecimal> ALL_PRICES =
    OrderFocus.items().via(ItemFocus.price());
```

This matters most for paths constructed by `andThen` chains, where the whole composition is rebuilt on every call. The saving is smaller but real for a single accessor too, because a generated accessor is a factory rather than a constant: `CompanyLenses.name()` calls `Lens.of(...)` and allocates a fresh `Lens` every time, and `CompanyFocus.name()` allocates a `Lens` and a `FocusPath`.

Both cases assume the path is used more than once. A path used once has no allocation to amortise, which is why [When to extract optics](#when-to-extract-optics) still says to inline it at the call site.

## Build-time impact

The annotation processor adds one code-generation pass to compilation. On a codebase with around a hundred annotated records the additional time is in the low single digits of seconds; large codebases scale roughly linearly with the number of annotated types.

Generated sources land under `build/generated/sources/annotationProcessor/java/main` (Gradle) or `target/generated-sources/annotations` (Maven). Most IDEs index these automatically after the first build. If autocomplete cannot see `XLenses` or `XFocus` types, a rebuild and project refresh resolves it.

Incremental compilation is supported, conservatively: every processor that generates code is registered with Gradle as *aggregating*, so a change to any annotated type re-runs generation across the source set rather than regenerating one companion class. That is deliberate, an isolating claim that turned out wrong would produce silently stale output, and consuming source sets stay incremental regardless. The one processor that generates nothing is registered as isolating: it marks hkj's annotations as handled, so that javac's `-Xlint:processing` does not report them (see below).

Every class file the processors write carries `@Generated`: the companion class, the navigator and stage classes nested inside it, and the classes that implement each traversal and fold. The marker has class retention, which is what JaCoCo's generated-code filter reads, so a coverage floor needs no exclude patterns for `XLenses`, `XFocus`, `XTraversals` or anything nested in them, and a build that carried such patterns can drop them. The same marker is what the [compile-time checks](../tooling/compile_checks.md#what-the-checker-detects) gate on.

Generated code is written to compile under `-Xlint:all -Werror`. javac reports every annotation that no processor claims, that is, declares it handles, so hkj's processors claim `@Generated` and every annotation they read alongside a generating one, such as `@MapField` or `@Wither`. Two warnings are outside hkj's reach: an annotation from another library that no processor claims, such as jspecify's `@NullMarked`, which `@EffectAlgebra` and `@ComposeEffects` write onto the classes they generate, or Spring's, which an `@HkjHttpClient` client carries; and, in a named module, the `exports` lint on a public signature that names a type from a module required without `transitive`. A build that keeps `-Werror` beside such annotations turns that one lint off with `-Xlint:all,-processing`; for the `exports` warning, declare the requirement `transitive`.

A type-use annotation you write on a component, a bound or a type argument is copied onto the types generated code writes out, so a `@Nullable` still reads as nullable in a lens's focus or a mapping Impl's leaf. An annotation the generated file cannot write cleanly is left off instead of breaking the build: one missing from the compile classpath, one declared private or inside a private class, one package-private to a package other than the one the file is written into, and one that is itself deprecated, which would draw a warning in a file you cannot put a `@SuppressWarnings` on. Inside a `@NullMarked` scope an unannotated type means non-null, so an annotation left off that way changes what the generated signature says: keep the nullness annotations generated code has to repeat public and current.

javac offers each round's annotations to the processors in processor-path order, and stops once every annotation in the round is claimed. A processor that supports every annotation, such as Lombok's, belongs ahead of `hkj-processor` on the processor path, or a round whose annotations are all hkj's never reaches it. A build that names its processors, with `-processor` or Maven's `<annotationProcessors>`, adds `org.higherkindedj.optics.processing.CompanionAnnotationProcessor` to the list; the HKJ Maven plugin adds it at its own release.

## When to extract optics

| Situation | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Path used once in a method body | Inline at call site (`UserFocus.address().city().get(user)`) |
| Path used multiple times in the same class | Extract to a `private static final` field |
| Path used across packages | Extract to a `public static final` field on a domain-optics utility class |
| Path constructed dynamically from runtime input | Build inside the method; do not cache |
| Path inside a tight loop | Extract to a local variable above the loop |

The optic value's type carries useful documentation. A `Lens<Company, String>` field named `companyName` reads more cleanly than a method that recomputes the path.

## Versioning and stability

The annotation surface (`@GenerateLenses`, `@GenerateFocus`, `@GeneratePrisms`, `@GenerateTraversals`, `@GenerateFolds`, `@GenerateGetters`, `@GenerateSetters`, `@GenerateIsos`, `@ImportOptics`, `OpticsSpec`) is the stable contract you depend on. Changes to method names on these annotations follow semantic-versioning expectations.

The shapes of generated classes (`XLenses`, `XFocus`, etc.) are also stable; existing fields and methods do not disappear without a deprecation cycle. New fields and methods may be added to support new annotation parameters; this is additive and source-compatible.

The Focus DSL surface (`FocusPath`, `AffinePath`, `TraversalPath`, methods like `.each()`, `.via()`, `.modifyAll()`) is stable. The Free Monad DSL APIs (`OpticPrograms`, `OpticInterpreters`) are also stable but used by fewer projects; if you adopt them, weigh the smaller adoption surface accordingly.

`Profunctor` adaptations (`contramap`, `map`, `dimap`) are stable.

When upgrading across minor versions, regenerate by rebuilding. Generated code is compatible with the runtime library version that produced it; mixing differently-versioned generated code and runtime jar can produce subtle runtime errors and is not supported.

## Team conventions that work

These are the conventions the library's own examples and tests follow. Treat them as defaults, not mandates.

- **Annotate the records you own as you write them.** Adding `@GenerateLenses` later is mechanical, but discovering mid-task that the optic does not exist is not. Weigh it against the build-time note above: generation scales with the number of annotated types, so "every record in the monorepo" is a different proposition from "every record in this module".
- **Place optic constants near the domain type.** A static `Optics` utility class next to the record carries the well-known paths.
- **Name paths after the field they end at.** `companyName`, not `companyToName` or `getCompanyName`. The receiver-style naming reads naturally at call sites: `Optics.companyName.set("...", company)`.
- **Use `Fold` when you only read.** Even when a `Lens` would work, expressing read-only intent makes reviews easier and prevents accidental mutations.
- **Reach for the Focus DSL first.** Manual `andThen` composition is fine and sometimes clearer, but the DSL gives you better IDE support and shorter call sites for nested updates.
- **Reserve the Free Monad DSL for problems that demand it.** If you do not have an audit, structural-analysis, or multi-mode requirement, the everyday APIs are simpler.
