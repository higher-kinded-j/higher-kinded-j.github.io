The recipes use the chapter's order-service cast, and declare any supporting type they need. Most also show their raw-optics form in a collapsed block, for a codebase that composes generated lenses by hand.

## Recipe 1: A field several records deep {#deep-field}

You want to replace one value three records down, such as the email on an order's customer, without rebuilding each record by hand.

``` java
    Order updated = OrderFocus.customer().email().value().set("ada@example.org", order);
```

~~~admonish example collapsible=true title="The same with raw optics"
``` java
    Lens<Order, String> email =
        OrderLenses.customer().andThen(CustomerLenses.email()).andThen(EmailAddressLenses.value());

    Order updated = email.set("ada@example.org", order);
```
~~~

`set` returns a new `Order`: it rebuilds the records on the path and reuses everything off it, the lines included. Chaining `.email().value()` straight on needs generated navigators, which `@GenerateFocus(generateNavigators = true)` turns on, here on `Order` and `Customer`. Without them, each hop is a `.via(...)`.

---

## Recipe 2: A field inside an `Optional` {#optional-field}

A customer profile's alternative email is an `Optional<EmailAddress>`, and you want to change the address when there is one.

``` java
    AffinePath<CustomerProfile, String> altEmail =
        CustomerProfileFocus.altEmail().via(EmailAddressFocus.value());

    CustomerProfile lowered = altEmail.modify(String::toLowerCase, profile);

    // With no alternative email, the profile comes back unchanged
    CustomerProfile untouched = altEmail.modify(String::toLowerCase, withoutAltEmail);
```

~~~admonish example collapsible=true title="The same with raw optics"
``` java
    Affine<CustomerProfile, String> altEmail =
        CustomerProfileLenses.altEmail()
            .andThen(Prisms.<EmailAddress>some())
            .andThen(EmailAddressLenses.value());

    CustomerProfile lowered = altEmail.modify(String::toLowerCase, profile);
```
~~~

An `Optional` component makes the generated path an `AffinePath`, which focuses zero or one value. `modify` leaves an empty `Optional` alone, and so does `set` here, because the path ends in a lens. A path whose last step is the `Optional`'s prism, such as `CustomerProfileFocus.altEmail()`, writes even when the `Optional` is empty: see [When the focus is absent](affine.md#when-the-focus-is-absent).

---

## Recipe 3: Every element, at any depth {#every-element}

An order history holds orders, and each order holds lines. You want to round every line's price to pence, across all of them.

``` java
// A customer's past orders: a list of orders, each holding a list of lines
@GenerateFocus
@GenerateTraversals
record OrderHistory(List<Order> orders) {}

```

``` java
    TraversalPath<OrderHistory, BigDecimal> prices =
        OrderHistoryFocus.orders().via(OrderFocus.lines()).via(LineItemFocus.price());

    OrderHistory rounded =
        prices.modifyAll(price -> price.setScale(2, RoundingMode.HALF_EVEN), history);
```

~~~admonish example collapsible=true title="The same with raw optics"
``` java
    Traversal<OrderHistory, BigDecimal> prices =
        OrderHistoryTraversals.orders()
            .andThen(OrderTraversals.lines())
            .andThen(LineItemLenses.price());

    OrderHistory rounded =
        Traversals.modify(prices, price -> price.setScale(2, RoundingMode.HALF_EVEN), history);
```
~~~

A `List` component's generated method already steps into the elements, so `OrderHistoryFocus.orders()` focuses each `Order`. Each `.via(...)` goes one level deeper, and `modifyAll` returns a new history with every price rounded. In plain Java the same change is two nested streams, each ending in a record's constructor.

---

## Recipe 4: Only the elements that match {#matching-elements}

You want to discount only the order lines of four or more items, and leave the others as they are.

``` java
    // Ten per cent off every line of four or more
    Order discounted =
        OrderFocus.lines()
            .filter(line -> line.quantity() >= 4)
            .via(LineItemFocus.price())
            .modifyAll(price -> price.multiply(new BigDecimal("0.90")), order);

    // The same test, with a change to the whole line
    Order doubled =
        OrderFocus.lines()
            .modifyWhen(
                line -> line.quantity() >= 4,
                line -> LineItemFocus.quantity().modify(quantity -> quantity * 2, line),
                order);
```

~~~admonish example collapsible=true title="The same with raw optics"
``` java
    Traversal<Order, BigDecimal> bulkPrices =
        OrderTraversals.lines()
            .filtered(line -> line.quantity() >= 4)
            .andThen(LineItemLenses.price());

    Order discounted =
        Traversals.modify(bulkPrices, price -> price.multiply(new BigDecimal("0.90")), order);
```
~~~

`filter` narrows the path to the matching lines, so the hops after it reach only those, and the other lines come back unchanged. `modifyWhen(condition, f, order)` is `filter` followed by `modifyAll`, for a change to the whole element.

~~~admonish tip title="Plain Java wins here"
For a condition on one record rather than on the elements of a list, an `if` around a single `set` reads best. A filter earns its place when the condition picks elements out of a list.
~~~

---

## Recipe 5: One variant of a sealed type {#one-variant}

A consignment's state is the sealed `ConsignmentState`: `Pending`, `Dispatched` or `Returned`. You want to tidy the reason on a returned consignment, and leave every other state alone.

``` java
    AffinePath<Consignment, String> returnReason =
        ConsignmentFocus.state().via(ConsignmentStatePrisms.returned()).via(ReturnedFocus.reason());

    Consignment tidied = returnReason.modify(String::strip, returned);

    // A consignment in any other state comes back unchanged
    Consignment untouched = returnReason.modify(String::strip, pending);
```

~~~admonish example collapsible=true title="The same with raw optics"
``` java
    Affine<Consignment, ConsignmentState.Returned> returnedState =
        ConsignmentLenses.state().andThen(ConsignmentStatePrisms.returned());

    // Returned has no generated lenses, so the function rebuilds the variant
    Consignment tidied =
        returnedState.modify(
            state -> new ConsignmentState.Returned(state.reason().strip()), consignment);
```
~~~

The generated prism `ConsignmentStatePrisms.returned()` matches one variant, so the path is an `AffinePath` that is empty for any other state. `modify` keeps the variant it matched. Moving a consignment to another state is a read followed by a build, as [the Quickstart's sealed type](quickstart.md#2-sum-types-and-collections-the-same-way) shows.

---

## Recipe 6: One variant in a list of mixed types {#variants-in-a-list}

A payment history holds a list of `Payment`, each a `Card` or a `Bank`. You want every card number, or every card number masked, and the bank payments skipped.

``` java
// The Collections, Optionals and Sealed Types page's payment history
@GenerateFocus
@GenerateTraversals
record PaymentHistory(UUID customerId, List<Payment> payments) {}

```

``` java
    TraversalPath<PaymentHistory, String> cardNumbers =
        PaymentHistoryFocus.payments().via(PaymentPrisms.card()).via(CardFocus.pan());

    // The bank payments are skipped
    List<String> pans = cardNumbers.getAll(history);

    PaymentHistory masked =
        cardNumbers.modifyAll(pan -> "**** " + pan.substring(pan.length() - 4), history);
```

~~~admonish example collapsible=true title="The same with raw optics"
``` java
    // Card carries no @GenerateLenses, so its lens is written by hand
    Lens<Card, String> pan = Lens.of(Card::pan, (_, newPan) -> new Card(newPan));

    Traversal<PaymentHistory, String> cardNumbers =
        PaymentHistoryTraversals.payments().andThen(PaymentPrisms.card()).andThen(pan);

    List<String> pans = Traversals.getAll(cardNumbers, history);
```
~~~

After `payments()` steps into the list, the prism keeps the cards and passes over the rest. The read skips the bank payments, and the write leaves them as they were. For a sealed type you cannot annotate, `AffinePath.instanceOf(Card.class)` takes the prism's place.

---

## Recipe 7: A map entry, with a fallback {#map-entry}

A stockroom keeps its stock by SKU in a `Map<String, Integer>`. You want a count that is zero for a SKU it has never held, and to change one entry.

``` java
// The stockroom an order is picked from: stock by SKU, and a name verified by a check
@GenerateLenses
@GenerateFocus(generateNavigators = true)
record Stockroom(String name, Map<String, Integer> stock, Either<String, String> verifiedName) {}

```

``` java
    AffinePath<Stockroom, Integer> desks = StockroomFocus.stock().atKey("DESK");
    AffinePath<Stockroom, Integer> lamps = StockroomFocus.stock().atKey("LAMP");

    // A missing key reads as the fallback
    int desksInStock = desks.getOrElse(0, stockroom);

    // modify changes a key that is there, and leaves a missing one alone
    Stockroom picked = lamps.modify(count -> count - 1, stockroom);

    // set adds a missing key
    Stockroom stocked = desks.set(5, stockroom);
```

~~~admonish example collapsible=true title="The same with raw optics"
``` java
    Affine<Stockroom, Integer> desks = StockroomLenses.stock().andThen(FocusPaths.mapAt("DESK"));

    int desksInStock = desks.getOptional(stockroom).orElse(0);
```
~~~

A `Map` component's path focuses the whole map, and `.atKey(key)` narrows it to one value that may be missing. `getOrElse` supplies the fallback for a missing key.

---

## Recipe 8: The value inside an `Either` field {#either-field}

A stockroom's `verifiedName` is an `Either<String, String>`: a `Right` once a check has passed, and a `Left` holding the reason when it has not. You want to tidy the name only when it was verified.

``` java
    AffinePath<Stockroom, String> verifiedName = StockroomFocus.verifiedName();

    // A Right is changed
    Stockroom tidied = verifiedName.modify(String::strip, verified);

    // A Left comes back unchanged
    Stockroom untouched = verifiedName.modify(String::strip, unverified);
```

~~~admonish example collapsible=true title="The same with raw optics"
``` java
    Affine<Stockroom, String> verifiedName =
        StockroomLenses.verifiedName().andThen(Prisms.<String, String>right());

    Stockroom tidied = verifiedName.modify(String::strip, verified);
```
~~~

The processor generates an `Either` component's path on its `Right` side, as an `AffinePath`, so a `Left` comes back unchanged.

~~~admonish tip title="Plain Java wins here"
For an `Either` on its own rather than a field inside a record, `either.map(String::strip)` does what the path's `modify` does. The path earns its place when the `Either` sits inside a record.
~~~

---

## Recipe 9: A PATCH that reports every bad field {#patch}

A PATCH request may carry a new name, a new email, both or neither. You want to apply what it carries, and to report every bad field at once, each by its name.

``` java
/** A sparse PATCH of a customer: a null component means "not supplied", not "set to null". */
record CustomerPatch(@Nullable String name, @Nullable String email) {}

/** The boundary parsers the recipe hands to {@code parseIfPresent}. */
final class Names {
  static Validated<NonEmptyList<FieldError>, String> parse(String raw) {
    String name = raw.strip();
    return name.isEmpty()
        ? Validated.invalidNel(FieldError.of("must not be blank"))
        : Validated.validNel(name);
  }

  private Names() {}
}

final class Emails {
  static Validated<NonEmptyList<FieldError>, EmailAddress> parse(String raw) {
    String email = raw.strip();
    return email.contains("@")
        ? Validated.validNel(new EmailAddress(email))
        : Validated.invalidNel(FieldError.of("not an address"));
  }

  private Emails() {}
}

```

``` java
    Validated<NonEmptyList<FieldError>, Customer> patched =
        Edits.accumulate(
                parseIfPresent(CustomerFocus.name(), patch.name(), Names::parse),
                parseIfPresent(CustomerFocus.email().toPath(), patch.email(), Emails::parse))
            .apply(customer);
```

~~~admonish example collapsible=true title="The same with raw optics"
``` java
    // A path built from a lens carries no label, so at(...) names each field
    Validated<NonEmptyList<FieldError>, Customer> patched =
        Edits.accumulate(
                parseIfPresent(FocusPath.of(CustomerLenses.name()), patch.name(), Names::parse)
                    .at("name"),
                parseIfPresent(FocusPath.of(CustomerLenses.email()), patch.email(), Emails::parse)
                    .at("email"))
            .apply(customer);
```
~~~

For a patch with a blank name and an email that has no `@`, `patched` is `Invalid(NonEmptyList[name: must not be blank, email: not an address])`. A patch that supplies only a good email changes only the email.

`parseIfPresent` does nothing for a `null` field. `Edits.accumulate` collects every failure in edit order, and writes only when every edit has parsed. A generated path carries its component's name, which is where `name:` and `email:` come from. A navigator hop such as `CustomerFocus.email()` hands over its path with `toPath()`. [Many Edits at Once](multi_edit.md) covers the rest of the builder.

---

## Recipe 10: Every value a path reaches, checked {#check-values}

Every line of an order must hold at least one item. You want to check every quantity, and report either each bad one or only the first.

``` java
/** The check the check-values recipe runs on every quantity. */
final class Quantities {
  static Validated<String, Integer> check(Integer quantity) {
    return quantity >= 1 ? Validated.valid(quantity) : Validated.invalid("No items: " + quantity);
  }

  private Quantities() {}
}

```

``` java
    Traversal<Order, Integer> quantities =
        OrderFocus.lines().via(LineItemFocus.quantity()).toTraversal();

    // Every bad quantity, reported together
    Validated<List<String>, Order> checked =
        OpticOps.modifyAllValidated(order, quantities, Quantities::check);

    // Or keep only the first
    Either<String, Order> firstFailure =
        OpticOps.modifyAllEither(
            order, quantities, quantity -> Quantities.check(quantity).toEither());
```

~~~admonish example collapsible=true title="The same with raw optics"
``` java
    Traversal<Order, Integer> quantities =
        OrderTraversals.lines().andThen(LineItemLenses.quantity());

    Validated<List<String>, Order> checked =
        OpticOps.modifyAllValidated(order, quantities, Quantities::check);
```
~~~

For an order whose lines hold 0 and -1 items, `checked` is `Invalid([No items: 0, No items: -1])` and `firstFailure` is `Left(No items: 0)`. A good order comes back valid and unchanged.

`OpticOps` takes a `Traversal`, which a `TraversalPath` hands over with `toTraversal()`. `modifyAllEither` keeps only the first error, but it still runs the check on every value. [Updates That Can Fail](fluent_api.md) has the forms for one field, and `modifyF` for an effect such as a remote price lookup.

---

## Recipe 11: Totals, counts and tests {#totals}

You want the number of items on an order, whether any line is a bulk line, and the order's total.

``` java
    TraversalPath<Order, Integer> quantities = OrderFocus.lines().via(LineItemFocus.quantity());

    int items = quantities.foldMap(Monoids.integerAddition(), quantity -> quantity, order);
    boolean anyBulk = quantities.exists(quantity -> quantity >= 4, order);
    boolean noEmptyLines = quantities.all(quantity -> quantity >= 1, order);
    int lineCount = OrderFocus.lines().count(order);

    // A money total over one list field is plain Java: Monoids offers no BigDecimal sum
    BigDecimal total =
        order.lines().stream()
            .map(line -> line.price().multiply(BigDecimal.valueOf(line.quantity())))
            .reduce(BigDecimal.ZERO, BigDecimal::add);
```

~~~admonish example collapsible=true title="The same with raw optics"
``` java
    Fold<Order, Integer> quantities =
        OrderTraversals.lines().andThen(LineItemLenses.quantity()).asFold();

    int items = quantities.foldMap(Monoids.integerAddition(), quantity -> quantity, order);
    boolean anyBulk = quantities.exists(quantity -> quantity >= 4, order);
    int lineCount = quantities.length(order);
```
~~~

For Ada's order of one lamp at 40.00 and four bulbs at 2.50, `items` is 5, `lineCount` is 2 and `total` is 50.00. A `TraversalPath` answers `exists`, `all`, `count` and `find` itself, and `foldMap` combines the values with a monoid such as `Monoids.integerAddition()`.

~~~admonish tip title="Plain Java wins here"
For a read of one list field, a stream over `order.lines()` is as short. The path earns its place when the values sit deeper, or when the same path also writes.
~~~

---

## Recipe 12: Values from several places {#several-places}

A customer profile always has a name, and sometimes a nickname. You want them as one list, or to ask one question of all of them.

``` java
    // The names a profile answers to: always a name, sometimes a nickname
    Fold<CustomerProfile, String> names =
        CustomerProfileFocus.name().asFold().plus(CustomerProfileFocus.nickname().asFold());

    List<String> all = names.getAll(profile);
    boolean known = names.exists(name -> name.equalsIgnoreCase("countess"), profile);

    // Three or more at once
    Fold<CustomerProfile, String> searchTerms =
        Fold.sum(
            CustomerProfileFocus.name().asFold(),
            CustomerProfileFocus.nickname().asFold(),
            CustomerProfileFocus.altEmail().via(EmailAddressFocus.value()).asFold());
```

~~~admonish example collapsible=true title="The same with raw optics"
``` java
    Fold<CustomerProfile, String> names =
        CustomerProfileLenses.name()
            .asFold()
            .plus(CustomerProfileLenses.nickname().andThen(Prisms.<String>some()).asFold());
```
~~~

For a profile named Ada Lovelace with the nickname Countess, `all` is `[Ada Lovelace, Countess]`. `asFold()` turns a path into a read-only `Fold`, and `plus` joins two folds, the first one's values coming first. `Fold.sum` joins three or more, so `searchTerms` adds the alternative email when there is one.

~~~admonish tip title="Plain Java wins here"
For one read, `Stream.concat(Stream.of(profile.name()), profile.nickname().stream()).toList()` is as short. A `Fold` earns its place as a value you hand to other code, which can ask it `exists`, `all` or `foldMap`.
~~~

---

## Recipe 13: Sorting and reversing {#sort}

You want an order's lines in price order, or in reverse order.

No Focus path sorts. `Traversals.sorted` and `Traversals.reversed` take a `Traversal`, such as the generated `OrderTraversals.lines()`, or a `TraversalPath`'s `toTraversal()`.

``` java
    Order byPrice =
        Traversals.sorted(OrderTraversals.lines(), Comparator.comparing(LineItem::price), order);

    Order reversed = Traversals.reversed(OrderTraversals.lines(), order);
```

Both read every focused value into a list, reorder the list, and write the values back to the places the traversal visits, in turn. A filtered traversal therefore sorts only the elements it keeps, and the others stay where they were. Sorting a traversal of prices, rather than of lines, moves the prices between lines.

---

## Recipe 14: Tracing a path {#trace}

A path reads fewer values than you expected, and you want to see what it finds.

``` java
    // In a service, the observer would call your logger
    List<String> log = new ArrayList<>();
    TraversalPath<Order, String> skus =
        OrderFocus.lines()
            .via(LineItemFocus.sku())
            .traced((_, found) -> log.add("read " + found.size() + " SKUs: " + found));

    List<String> read = skus.getAll(order);
    // the log now holds "read 2 SKUs: [LAMP, BULB]"
```

On a `TraversalPath`, the observer runs on every read built on `getAll`, such as `count` and `exists`. A write such as `modifyAll` does not call it, and nor does `foldMap`, which reads through the traversal. A `via` or `filter` after `traced` returns a path without the observer, so trace last. Tracing belongs to the Focus paths, and has no raw-optics form.
