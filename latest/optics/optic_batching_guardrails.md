## The Friday-Afternoon Call

It's quarter to five. The on-call channel pings: "What did that endpoint *actually* do? It just hammered the user service with twelve thousand ids in one call and the SREs are unhappy." You look at the code. It's an optic traversal. It batched, just as designed. The optic did exactly what you asked it to do. The problem is that nobody asked beforehand whether that was a sensible thing to ask.

That is what this page is about. Three things you want, once an optic run has any chance of producing a sizeable batch.

| Question | When you ask it | Answer |
|---|---|---|
| "What would this dispatch, if I let it?" | Before the call leaves the JVM | `Plans.preflight(program)` |
| "Stop me if I'm about to do something stupid." | At the round boundary, every round | `Guards.maxKeysPerRound(n)` and friends |
| "Tell me, as data, that you stopped me." | At the failure site | `SafeFetch.runCachedWithGuard(...)` |

Two small primitives, one familiar railway pattern, no surprises.

## "What Would Round 1 Be?"

A `Fetch` program is a value. It hasn't run yet. `program` throughout this page is the one built on [Optic-Driven Batching](optic_batching.md): an optic over a team's member ids with `FetchApplicative` as the strategy, not yet handed to a runner. You can pull its first round's pending-key set out without touching a backend, which is what `Plans.preflight` does:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Caller
    participant P as Fetch program
    participant R as Runner
    participant B as Backend

    Note over C,B: Online: Fetch.runCached, real I/O
    C->>R: runCached(program, resolver)
    R->>P: pending()
    P-->>R: { id_1 ... id_N }
    R->>B: resolver({ id_1 ... id_N })
    B-->>R: { id_1: v_1 ... id_N: v_N }
    R-->>C: RunResult(value, rounds=1, fetchedBatches=[...])

    Note over C,B: Offline: Plans.preflight, no I/O
    C->>R: preflight(program)
    R->>P: pending()
    P-->>R: { id_1 ... id_N }
    Note right of R: resume with stub nulls:<br/>no backend, no values, no side effects
    R->>P: resume(stub map)
    P-->>R: Done, or another Blocked
    R-->>C: Plan(fetchedBatches=[...], truncated=?)
```

Top half: the real run, the one that bills your cloud account. Bottom half: the inspection, the one you can put inside an `assertThat`. Same keysets. Different boundary.

<!-- verify -->
```java
Plan<UserId> plan = Plans.preflight(program);
plan.rounds();           // how many rounds it observed
plan.fetchedBatches();   // each round's keyset, in order
plan.totalKeyCount();    // sum across observed rounds
plan.truncated();        // could the walk see all rounds?
```

The walk uses stub `null` values where the real run would have real ones. Two outcomes:

- The combine logic survives the null (`"foo" + null` is `"foonull"`, `ArrayList::add(null)` is fine). The walk reaches `Done`; `truncated` is `false`; the plan is complete.
- Something rejects the null (`List.of(first)`, an `Objects.equals` on a primitive, a `flatMap` that actually reads the value). The walk halts where it stood; `truncated` is `true`. **Round 1 is still accurate**, and that's the dispatch you care about for an audit log or a budget guard.

~~~admonish note title="Why round 1 is special"
A traversal that collapses N foci to a single batched call is *one round*. Its keyset is *the* dispatch. That's the headline case for optic batching, and it's exactly the case preflight observes reliably. Past round 1, programs that mix `flatMap` dependencies with null-rejecting combines lose visibility, and that's honest: a monadic dependency really does need a value to decide what to fetch next.

## "Stop Me If I'm About To Do Something Stupid."

The other half of the chapter doesn't ask offline; it asks at the round boundary, during the real run, just before each dispatch. That's a `Guard`:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Caller
    participant R as Runner
    participant G as Guard
    participant B as Resolver

    C->>R: runCached(program, resolver, guard)
    loop per round
        R->>R: compute uncached keyset
        R->>G: check(keys, roundIndex, backendCallsSoFar)
        alt keys within budget
            G-->>R: pass
            R->>B: resolver(keys)
            B-->>R: values
        else budget exceeded
            G-->>R: throw GuardViolationException
            Note over R,B: resolver is never called
            R-->>C: exception, or Either.left via SafeFetch
        end
    end
    R-->>C: RunResult
```

<!-- verify -->
```java
// Refuse a round that would dispatch more than 500 keys.
Guard<UserId> ceiling = Guards.maxKeysPerRound(500);

// Cap rounds (kill runaway flatMap chains).
Guard<UserId> bounded = Guards.maxRounds(8);

// Cap backend calls across the whole run.
Guard<UserId> calls = Guards.maxBackendCalls(4);

// Log every dispatched round.
Guard<UserId> audit = Guards.audit((keys, round) ->
    log.info("optic dispatch round={} keys={}", round, keys.size()));

// Compose: audit everything, but refuse the oversized.
Guard<UserId> composed = audit.and(ceiling);

Fetch.RunResult<UserId, Team> result =
    Guards.runCached(program, backend::loadAll, composed);
```

A guard inspects, then either passes (the runner dispatches) or throws `GuardViolationException`. A refusal aborts the run *before* the resolver runs: the dispatch never leaves the JVM, the SREs stay happy, and the exception carries the offending round index and keyset so the rejection is loggable.

`Guards.runCached` and `Guards.runAsync` are drop-in replacements for the substrate runners with the guard threaded in.

---

## Refusal as a Value

For callers that compose with `Either`, the railway wrappers move guard refusal onto the value channel:

<!-- verify -->
```java
public Response handleTeamRequest() {
    Either<Throwable, Fetch.RunResult<UserId, Team>> outcome =
        SafeFetch.runCachedWithGuard(program, backend::loadAll, composed);

    return outcome.fold(
        failure -> badRequest(failure.getMessage()),
        success -> ok(success.value()));
}
```

`Either.left` carries the `GuardViolationException` (or any other failure the run produced). `Either.right` carries the `RunResult`. The run never throws; the safe-async future never completes exceptionally. Same shape every controller already knows.

## Quick Reference

| You want to ... | Use |
|---|---|
| Log the keyset before any I/O | `Plans.preflight(program)` |
| Assert "this optic would dispatch these keys" in a test | `Plans.preflight(program)` |
| Refuse a run if it would dispatch more than N keys | `Guards.maxKeysPerRound(n)` + `Guards.runCached` |
| Cap a runaway `flatMap` chain at N rounds | `Guards.maxRounds(n)` |
| Cap total backend calls (multi-round programs) | `Guards.maxBackendCalls(n)` |
| Log every dispatched round | `Guards.audit(sink)` |
| Turn a refusal into `Either.left` | `SafeFetch.runCachedWithGuard` |

## Limits, Stated Up Front

- **Round 1 only is universally observable offline.** Past round 1, `Plans.preflight` walks programs whose combines accept `null`; the rest truncate. `Plan.truncated()` is the honest signal.
- **Guards do not retry.** A refused round aborts the run; it does not "wait and try a smaller batch". `BatchLoaders.chunked` does not soften that: the guard checks the round's uncached keyset *before* the loader is called, so `maxKeysPerRound(500)` refuses a 501-key round that `chunked` would otherwise have split. Chunking caps what one dispatch sends, not what one round may ask for.
- **`maxBackendCalls` counts non-empty rounds only.** A round whose keys are all already cached costs no backend call and does not consume a budget slot.

~~~admonish info title="Key Takeaways"
* **A plan is inspectable before it runs.** `Plans.preflight` gives you round 1's keyset with no I/O, which is both a logging hook and a test assertion.
* **Round 1 is the honest boundary.** Beyond it, preflight only walks programs whose combines tolerate `null`; the rest report `Plan.truncated()` rather than guessing.
* **Guards refuse, they do not retry.** A violated bound aborts the run, and it is checked before the loader runs, so `BatchLoaders.chunked` cannot rescue an over-budget round. Chunking limits a single dispatch; the guard limits the round.
* **Refusal can be a value.** `SafeFetch.runCachedWithGuard` puts the `GuardViolationException` on `Either.left`, so the run never throws and controllers keep the shape they already have.
* **An all-cached round is free.** `maxBackendCalls` counts only rounds that reach the resolver, so caching does not silently consume the budget.
