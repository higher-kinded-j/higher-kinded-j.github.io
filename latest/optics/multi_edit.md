# Many Edits at Once

_Apply several edits as one update, or check a REST `PATCH` and report every bad field at once._

~~~admonish info title="What You'll Learn"
- Combine edits at different paths into one reusable update with `Edits.combine`
- Write a sparse update, where a `null` field means "leave it alone", with no `if` per field
- Check every field of a REST `PATCH` with `Edits.accumulate`, and report all the bad ones together
- Edit fields a record's constructor checks together, so it sees only the final values
~~~

~~~admonish example title="See Example Code"
**The code on this page is [MultiEditBook.java](https://github.com/higher-kinded-j/higher-kinded-j/blob/main/hkj-examples/src/main/java/org/higherkindedj/example/book/optics/MultiEditBook.java)**: the page includes it directly, so the build compiles and runs it.

## The problem

A path makes one edit at a time. The everyday case is several edits at once, and the classic one is a REST `PATCH` that tidies the email, trims the SKU, and bumps the quantity. By hand that means threading the value through every step, guarding each optional field with an `if`, and, if you validate at all, throwing on the first bad field:

``` java
    Order updated = order;
    if (req.email() != null) {
      updated = updated.withEmail(req.email().toLowerCase()); // thread the result...
    }
    if (req.sku() != null) {
      updated = updated.withSku(req.sku().trim()); // ...through every step
    }
    if (req.qtyDelta() != null) {
      updated = updated.withQuantity(updated.quantity() + req.qtyDelta());
    }
    // And if the email was malformed? You throw on the first bad field and never see the rest.
```

Three pains recur: one `if` per optional field, the value re-threaded by hand at every step, and validation that stops at the first error instead of collecting them all. If you use MapStruct for this, its answer is `@MappingTarget` with `NullValuePropertyMappingStrategy.IGNORE`, and [Coming from MapStruct](../mapping/from_mapstruct.md#from-mapstruct) sets the two side by side.

---

## The solution: two entry points

The `org.higherkindedj.optics.edit` package folds all of that into two operations. Which one you reach for depends only on whether any edit can *fail*:

| Entry point | Reach for it when | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `Edits.combine(...)` | every edit is always safe (no validation) | one reusable `Update<S>` |
| `Edits.accumulate(...)` | some edits validate their input (a REST `PATCH`) | a patch you apply to get `Validated<NonEmptyList<FieldError>, S>` |

Those are the whole API, with one more form of `accumulate` for [fields a constructor checks together](#fields-a-constructor-checks-together). The rest of this page is how each one behaves, and how the compiler keeps a validating edit from slipping into `combine` by accident.

---

## Edits that cannot fail: `Edits.combine` {#pure-multi-edit-editscombine}

Each `Edit` factory pairs an optic (a `FocusPath` or a `Setter`) with a value or function. `combine` joins them, in order, into one `Update<Order>`: a function from order to order that you can name and reuse.

``` java
import static org.higherkindedj.optics.edit.Edit.*;

    Update<Order> normalise =
        Edits.combine(modify(EMAIL, String::toLowerCase), modify(SKU, String::trim));

    Order orderA = new Order("ORD-1", "A@B.COM", " sku ", 1);
    Order orderB = new Order("ORD-2", "C@D.COM", " sku2 ", 2);

    Order a = normalise.apply(orderA);
    Order b = normalise.andThen(APPLY_DISCOUNT).apply(orderB); // Update composes further
```

Only pure `Edit`s fit `combine`'s signature; a fallible edit is rejected **at compile time**, so validation failures can never be silently dropped.

---

## Sparse updates: absent means "leave it alone"

The `…IfPresent` factories treat `null` as *absent*: the edit changes nothing, so a sparse request DTO lands one-to-one with no `if` ceremony:

``` java
    Edit<Order> number = setIfPresent(ORDER_NUMBER, req.orderNumber()); // null -> no-op
    Edit<Order> quantity = modifyIfPresent(QUANTITY, req.qtyDelta(), (delta, qty) -> qty + delta);
```

Each request field maps to exactly one slot; an absent field simply contributes nothing to the fold:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    accTitle: A sparse request, field by field
    accDescr: A request with an email, no SKU and a quantity delta of 3. The email is written, the absent SKU changes nothing, and the quantity grows by 3, so the order comes back with its email and quantity changed and its SKU untouched.
    Req(["PatchRequest<br/>email: a@b.example, sku: null, qtyDelta: 3"])
    Req --> E(["email present<br/>write it"])
    Req --> S(["sku absent<br/>no change"])
    Req --> Q(["qtyDelta present<br/>qty += 3"])
    E --> Out(["order': email and quantity changed,<br/>sku untouched"])
    S --> Out
    Q --> Out

    classDef tier fill:#a6d189,stroke:#40a02b,color:#232634
    classDef out fill:#e5c890,stroke:#df8e1d,color:#232634
    class Req,E,S,Q tier
    class Out out
```

~~~admonish warning title="Absent and null are deliberately the same"
A sparse edit cannot *clear* a field: `setIfPresent(path, null)` means "no change requested", not "set to null". This suits non-null domain models; if a field must be clearable, model the cleared state explicitly (e.g. `Maybe`) and `set` it. The functions given to `modifyIfPresent`/`parseIfPresent` are never invoked with `null`.
~~~

## Validated PATCH: `Edits.accumulate`

`parseIfPresent` parses the incoming value first, and a generated path locates any failure **automatically** from its own label. The parser you hand it has exactly the shape of a [`ValidatedPrism`](validated_prism.md)'s `parse`, so a boundary defined once as a prism passes its `parse` here. This request's order number and email are both bad:

~~~admonish example title="The two parsers" collapsible=true
``` java
/** The boundary parsers the page hands to {@code parseIfPresent}. */
final class OrderNumber {
  static Validated<NonEmptyList<FieldError>, String> parse(String raw) {
    return raw.matches("ORD-\\d+")
        ? Validated.validNel(raw)
        : Validated.invalidNel(FieldError.of("not an order number"));
  }

  private OrderNumber() {}
}

final class Email {
  static Validated<NonEmptyList<FieldError>, String> parse(String raw) {
    return raw.contains("@")
        ? Validated.validNel(raw)
        : Validated.invalidNel(FieldError.of("not an address"));
  }

  private Email() {}
}
```
~~~

``` java
    Validated<NonEmptyList<FieldError>, Order> patched =
        Edits.accumulate(
                parseIfPresent(ORDER_NUMBER, req.orderNumber(), OrderNumber::parse),
                parseIfPresent(EMAIL, req.email(), Email::parse),
                modifyIfPresent(QUANTITY, req.qtyDelta(), (delta, qty) -> qty + delta))
            .apply(order);
    // Invalid(NonEmptyList[orderNumber: not an order number, email: not an address])
    //   <- or Valid(order) with only the present fields changed
```

`accumulate` checks **every** edit independently and reports **all** the bad fields at once, each named by its path. The errors arrive in edit order on the `NonEmptyList`, as in the [accumulating assembly](../monads/validated_assembly.md), and one patch can hold any number of edits.

~~~admonish tip title="Generated paths label themselves"
A path from a `@GenerateFocus` companion carries its record-component name as a **segment**: `OrderFocus.email()` is labelled `"email"`. Composing paths joins the segments, so `customer.via(address).via(zip)` is `"customer.address.zip"`, which `segments()` and `pathString()` return. `parseIfPresent` locates failures with them **automatically**, so a generated path needs no `.at(...)`. An explicit `.at(label)` still prepends outward, for a hand-written optic or extra context, as `FieldError.at` does.
~~~

To carry on in an Effect Path, `applyPath(order)` is the `ValidationPath` twin of `apply(order)`, and `toValidated()` exposes the folded `Update` itself for reuse.

~~~admonish tip title="Generate this when the shape is regular"
When the request DTO's fields line up one-to-one with a domain record, the common REST PATCH case, you need not hand-write the fold at all. `@GenerateMapping` on an [`UpdateSpec<Domain, Wire>`](../mapping/beans_patch.md#sparse-patch-write-back-updatespec) generates this `Edits.accumulate` over the present fields, in its [construct-once form](#fields-a-constructor-checks-together). It returns `updateFrom(wire) : Edits.Accumulated<Domain>`, with the same `apply`, `applyPath` and `toValidated`. Reach for the hand-written `Edits` here when the edits are irregular (a `qtyDelta` that *modifies*, coupled fields, a computed target); reach for `UpdateSpec` when each present field maps to one slot.
~~~

## How the split stays compile-time safe

`combine` accepts only pure edits; `accumulate` accepts both. That is not a rule you have to remember: it is carried by the type of each edit. `set`, `modify`, and the `…IfPresent` forms produce an `Edit` (cannot fail); `parseIfPresent` produces a `FallibleEdit` (may fail). Passing a `FallibleEdit` to `combine` does not compile, so a validation failure can never be silently dropped.

```mermaid

    accTitle: How combine and accumulate tell the edits apart
    accDescr: parseIfPresent makes a FallibleEdit, which may fail. set, modify and the IfPresent forms make an Edit, which cannot fail, and every Edit is also a FallibleEdit. Edits.combine takes only Edits, so a FallibleEdit there is a compile error; Edits.accumulate takes both.

## Semantics: validate everything, then write once

An accumulated patch works in two phases:

1. **Validate**: each edit's incoming value is checked independently. Validation never sees a source, so every check runs, and one patch applies to many sources.
2. **Apply**: only if every edit validated, the writes run as a single left-to-right fold.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    accTitle: Validate everything, then write once
    accDescr: In phase 1 each edit is checked on its own, with no source: an absent SKU is a valid no-op, the email is parsed, and a present quantity delta is a valid write. If every edit is valid, phase 2 runs the writes as one left-to-right fold; otherwise the result is Invalid with every bad field located.
    subgraph one["Phase 1: validate each edit independently, no source involved"]
        direction TB
        S1(["setIfPresent(SKU, null)<br/>absent, so no change"]) --> V1(["Valid, a no-op"])
        S2(["parseIfPresent(EMAIL, raw)<br/>the parser runs"]) --> V2(["Valid(write)<br/>or Invalid(errors)"])

    Q -->|"yes"| Ok(["Phase 2: one left-to-right fold<br/>Valid(order'), only the present fields written"])
    Q -->|"no"| Bad(["Invalid(NEL[email: …])<br/>every bad field, located"])

Application order is observable only when paths overlap: disjoint paths commute; an edit at an overlapping path sees the previous edit's result (a `modify` reads the *current* value at application time). Genuinely coupled fields belong in one atomic edit (see [Coupled Fields](coupled_fields.md) and `Lens.paired`), or, when a record's constructor checks them against each other, [onto a focus](#fields-a-constructor-checks-together).

---

## Fields a constructor checks together {#fields-a-constructor-checks-together}

Each write through a record's path builds a new record, so the constructor sees every value the fold passes through. Take a range whose constructor refuses `lo > hi`. It cannot move from `Range(1, 3)` to `Range(5, 10)` one end at a time: writing `lo` first builds `Range(5, 3)`, and the constructor throws before `hi` is written, although the final range is valid.

`Edits.accumulate(focus, edits...)` takes a `Lens` to a value carrying the fields the edits set, with no check of its own. The edits write onto that value, and the lens sets it back once, so the constructor sees only the final values:

``` java
record Range(int lo, int hi) {
  Range {
    if (lo > hi) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("lo > hi");
    }
  }
}

@GenerateFocus
record Ends(int lo, int hi) {} // the fields the edits set, with no check of their own

```

``` java
    Lens<Range, Ends> ends =
        Lens.of(r -> new Ends(r.lo(), r.hi()), (r, e) -> new Range(e.lo(), e.hi()));

    Validated<NonEmptyList<FieldError>, Range> moved =
        Edits.accumulate(
                ends,
                setIfPresent(EndsFocus.lo(), move.lo()),
                setIfPresent(EndsFocus.hi(), move.hi()))
            .apply(new Range(1, 3));
    // Valid(Range[lo=5, hi=10])
    //   <- both ends move together. Moving lo alone would make Range(5, 3), which the
    //      record's own constructor refuses, and the refusal arrives as a located error.
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    accTitle: One record per edit, or one record in all
    accDescr: With plain accumulate, setting lo to 5 on Range(1, 3) builds Range(5, 3), which the constructor refuses. With accumulate onto the Ends focus, lo and hi are written onto Ends(1, 3) in turn, giving Ends(5, 10), and the lens sets it back once as Range(5, 10).
    subgraph each["accumulate(edits…): one record per edit"]

`@GenerateMapping` on an [`UpdateSpec`](../mapping/beans_patch.md#fields-a-constructor-checks-together) generates exactly this: its `updateFrom` writes onto the components a PATCH can set and constructs the domain record once.

~~~admonish tip title="You can ship now"
You can now update nested records, check what you write, and apply a PATCH that reports every bad field. The On demand groups that follow are for when a task needs them, and [When the constructor refuses](#when-the-constructor-refuses) is the fine print of this page.
~~~

---

## The fine print {#the-fine-print}

### When the constructor refuses {#when-the-constructor-refuses}

The edits validate exactly as they do in `accumulate`, and their errors are reported alone: the record is constructed only once every edit validated. After that, `apply` treats each kind of exception its own way:

| What happens | What `apply` returns |
|---|---|
| Setting the focus back throws a `RuntimeException`: the constructor refusing the final values | An unlabelled `FieldError` carrying the exception's message, or `not a valid Range` when the message is missing or blank |
| An edit's own function, or reading the focus, throws | Nothing: the exception propagates, since only setting the focus back is guarded |
| Every edit is absent | The source as it is, without setting the focus |

`toValidated()` hands back an `Update` that writes onto the focus and sets it back once. An `Update` has no error channel, so a refusal throws from it.

The edits' errors are located relative to the focus. Where the focus is a nested component rather than the source's own fields, add the component's name to each edit with `.at("range")`, so their errors and the source agree on where they are.

---

~~~admonish info title="Key Takeaways"
* **`Edits.combine` joins edits that cannot fail into one reusable `Update<S>`.** A fallible edit does not compile there.
* **An absent value changes nothing.** The `…IfPresent` forms take a sparse request field by field, with no `if`.
* **`Edits.accumulate` checks every edit and reports every bad field.** The errors arrive located and in edit order, and a patch holds any number of edits.
* **A patch validates first, then writes once.** Validation never sees the source, and the writes run left to right only when every edit passed.
* **Overlapping paths see earlier writes.** Fields that must change together belong in one atomic edit, such as `Lens.paired`.
* **`Edits.accumulate(focus, …)` builds the record once.** A constructor that checks fields against each other sees only the final values, and its refusal is an `Invalid`.
