That ends the everyday pages. This group and the ones after it are On demand: read a page when a task needs it, and skip it until then.

Every Focus path is built from optics, and this group gives each single-value optic a page of its own. Read one when a path does something you want to understand, or when you need an optic the Focus DSL does not generate for you. Here is the destination, before any theory: a reusable path from an `Order` down to its customer's email address, composed by hand from generated lenses, and two one-line updates through it. The build compiles and runs it, and a test holds each value the comments show:

``` java
    var email =
        OrderLenses.customer().andThen(CustomerLenses.email()).andThen(EmailAddressLenses.value());

    Order changed = email.set("ada@example.org", order);
    Order shouted = email.modify(String::toUpperCase, order);
    // email.get(changed) -> "ada@example.org"
    // email.get(shouted) -> "ADA@EXAMPLE.COM"
    // each record on the path is rebuilt for you and the lines are reused; order is untouched
```

A **Lens** focuses a field that is always there. A **Prism** focuses one variant of a sealed type, which might not match. An **Affine** focuses a value that may be absent, such as an `Optional` field. An **Iso** converts between two shapes of the same information. [Decision Trees](decision_trees.md#tree-1-which-optic-do-i-need) picks one for your data, and [Composition Rules](composition_rules.md) says what type two of them compose to.

~~~admonish tip title="Why this matters"
Three things separate these optics from a bag of getter helpers. They are **generated**: annotate a record and the boilerplate is the processor's problem, forever in sync with the fields. They are **effect-ready**: the same path that does a pure `set` today runs a validating, accumulating, or asynchronous update tomorrow through [`modifyF`](../glossary/optics.md#modifyf), because every settable optic is generic over an [`Applicative`](../glossary/type-classes.md#applicative). And they are **lawful**: the round-trip laws each optic must satisfy are published in `hkj-test` and checked, not assumed.
