# Path Types

> *"It is not down on any map; true places never are."*

> — Herman Melville, *Moby-Dick*

Melville was speaking of Queequeg's island home, but the observation applies
to software: the territory you're navigating (nullable returns, network
failures, validation errors, deferred effects) isn't marked on any class
diagram. You need to choose your vessel before setting sail.

This chapter covers each Path type in detail. But before cataloguing the
fleet, a more pressing question: *which one do you need?*

## Choosing Your Path

Before diving into specifics, orient yourself by the problem you're solving:

```
                             START HERE
                                 │
                      Can the operation fail?
                           /          \
                         No            Yes
                         │              │
                  Is the value      Do you need ALL
                  optional?          errors at once?
                   /     \            /          \
                 Yes      No        Yes           No
                  │        │         │             │
              MaybePath  IdPath  ValidationPath    │
                                              Is the error a
                                              typed domain error
                                              or an exception?
                                               /            \
                                            Typed        Exception
                                             │              │
                                      Is the work        TryPath
                                      asynchronous?
                                       /        \
                                     Yes         No
                                      │           │
                                 VResultPath  EitherPath
```

*The decision tree above covers the seven core path types in this section. For deferred side effects, [`IOPath`](path_io.md) and [`VTaskPath`](path_vtask.md) follow shortly. For stack-safe recursion via [`TrampolinePath`](path_trampoline.md), and for free-monad DSLs via [`FreePath`](path_free.md) / [`FreeApPath`](path_freeap.md), see [Advanced Paths](advanced_topics.md).*

### _"The value might not exist"_

You're dealing with absence: a lookup that returns nothing, an optional
configuration, a field that might be null.

**Reach for [`MaybePath`](path_maybe.md)** if absence is normal and expected, not an error
condition. Nobody needs to know *why* the value is missing.

**Reach for [`OptionalPath`](path_optional.md)** if you're bridging to Java's `Optional` ecosystem
and want to stay close to the standard library.

### _"The operation might fail, and I need to know why"_

Something can go wrong, and the error carries information: a validation
message, a typed error code, a domain-specific failure.

**Reach for [`EitherPath`](path_either.md)** when you control the error type and want typed,
structured errors.

**Reach for [`TryPath`](path_try.md)** when you're wrapping code that throws exceptions and
want to stay in exception-land (with `Throwable` as the error type).

**Reach for [`VResultPath`](path_vresult.md)** when the fallible operation is also
asynchronous: the typed-error railway of `EitherPath` running on `VTask` virtual
threads (`VTask<Either<E, A>>`), without hand-carrying an `Either` through `VTaskPath`.

### _"I need ALL the errors, not just the first"_

Multiple independent validations, and stopping at the first failure would
be unkind to your users.

**Reach for [`ValidationPath`](path_validation.md)** with `zipWithAccum` to accumulate every error.

### _"The operation has side effects I want to defer"_

You're reading files, calling APIs, writing to databases, effects that
shouldn't happen until you're ready.

**Reach for [`IOPath`](path_io.md)** to describe the effect without executing it. Nothing
runs until you call `unsafeRun()`.

### _"I need concurrent operations at scale"_

You're building services that handle many concurrent requests, calling
multiple APIs in parallel, or processing streams of events.

**Reach for [`VTaskPath`](path_vtask.md)** for virtual thread-based concurrency. Write
simple blocking code that scales to millions of concurrent tasks without
the complexity of reactive streams. When those concurrent operations fail with a
typed domain error rather than an exception, reach for
[`VResultPath`](path_vresult.md) instead.

### _"I need lazy streaming with virtual threads"_

You have data arriving from paginated APIs, sensors, or infinite sequences,
and you want to process it lazily without materialising everything in memory.

**Reach for [`VStreamPath`](path_vstream.md)** for pull-based streaming on virtual
threads. Elements are produced one at a time, the consumer controls the pace,
and terminal operations bridge back to `VTaskPath`.

### _"I need stack-safe recursion"_

Deep recursive algorithms that would blow the stack with direct recursion.

**Reach for [`TrampolinePath`](path_trampoline.md)** for guaranteed stack safety regardless of depth.

### _"I want to build an interpretable DSL"_

Separate description from execution, test with mock interpreters, or support
multiple interpretation strategies.

**Reach for [`FreePath`](path_free.md)** for sequential DSLs or
[`FreeApPath`](path_freeap.md) for parallel/static-analysis-friendly DSLs.

### _"The operation always succeeds"_

No failure case, no absence; you just want Path operations on a pure value.

**Reach for [`IdPath`](path_id.md)** when you need a trivial Path for generic code or testing.

### _"None of the above"_

You have a custom monad, or you're writing highly generic code.

**Reach for [`GenericPath`](path_generic.md)** as the escape hatch; it wraps any `Kind<F, A>`
with a `Monad` instance.

## Path Types by Category

### Value Containers (Immediate Evaluation)

These types wrap values and evaluate operations immediately:

- **[MaybePath](path_maybe.md)** - For values that might be absent
- **[OptionalPath](path_optional.md)** - Bridge to Java's `Optional`
- **[IdPath](path_id.md)** - Always contains a value (identity)

### Error Handling (Immediate Evaluation)

These types handle failures with different strategies:

- **[EitherPath](path_either.md)** - Typed errors, short-circuit on first failure
- **[TryPath](path_try.md)** - Exception-based errors
- **[ValidationPath](path_validation.md)** - Accumulate all errors
- **[EitherOrBothPath](path_either_or_both.md)** - Success that can still carry non-fatal warnings

### Deferred Computation

These types describe computations without executing them:

- **[IOPath](path_io.md)** - Side effects, runs when you call `unsafeRun()`
- **[VTaskPath](path_vtask.md)** - Virtual thread concurrency, runs when you call `run()`
- **[VResultPath](path_vresult.md)** - Async work with a typed domain error (`VTask<Either<E, A>>`)
- **[VStreamPath](path_vstream.md)** - Lazy pull-based streaming on virtual threads
- **[TrampolinePath](path_trampoline.md)** - Stack-safe recursion

### DSL Building

These types support building domain-specific languages:

- **[FreePath](path_free.md)** - Sequential, monadic DSLs
- **[FreeApPath](path_freeap.md)** - Parallel, applicative DSLs

### Universal

- **[GenericPath](path_generic.md)** - Works with any monad

## Summary: Choosing Your Vessel

| Scenario | Path Type | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| Value might be absent | `MaybePath` | Simple presence/absence |
| Operation might fail with typed error | `EitherPath` | Structured error handling |
| Wrapping exception-throwing code | `TryPath` | Exception → functional bridge |
| Side effects to defer | `IOPath` | Lazy, referential transparency |
| Concurrent operations at scale | `VTaskPath` | Virtual threads, simple blocking code |
| Async operation with a typed error | `VResultPath` | Virtual threads plus a typed error channel |
| Lazy streaming with virtual threads | `VStreamPath` | Pull-based, infinite-safe, backpressure |
| Need ALL validation errors | `ValidationPath` | Error accumulation |
| Bridging Java's Optional | `OptionalPath` | Stdlib compatibility |
| Always succeeds, pure value | `IdPath` | Generic/testing contexts |
| Custom monad | `GenericPath` | Universal escape hatch |
| Deep recursion without stack overflow | `TrampolinePath` | Stack-safe trampolining |
| DSL with sequential operations | `FreePath` | Interpretable programs |
| DSL with independent operations | `FreeApPath` | Static analysis, parallel |

The choice isn't always obvious, and that's fine. You can convert between
types as your needs evolve (`MaybePath` to `EitherPath` when you need error
messages, `TryPath` to `EitherPath` when you want typed errors). The
[Type Conversions](conversions.md) chapter covers these conversions in detail.
