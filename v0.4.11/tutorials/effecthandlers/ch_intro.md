# Effect Handlers Journey

~~~admonish info title="What We'll Learn"
- Modelling effects as algebras (sealed interfaces of operations)
- Writing programs as values that we then interpret
- Composing multiple effect algebras with `EitherF`
- Multiple interpretations of one program: production, test, audit, dry-run, replay
- Static program inspection before execution
~~~

**Tutorials**: 6 | **Exercises**: 19 | **Prerequisites**: complete the [Effect API Journey](../effect/effect_journey.md) and [Core: Advanced Patterns](../coretypes/advanced_journey.md) (Free Monad / Free Applicative).

~~~admonish tip title="Where This Fits in the Bigger Picture"
This journey is the value-level form of "Hexagonal Architecture without DI": instead of injecting interfaces and mocking them in tests, we model the effects as a sealed-interface ADT and write the program as a `Free` value over it. One program, many interpreters: production runs against real services, tests run against in-memory mocks, audit runs accumulate a trace, dry-run runs validate without executing.

Each tutorial opens with a Pain → Promise header showing the imperative-Java pattern (interface + mock framework + ad-hoc trace logging) the value-level effect algebra replaces.
