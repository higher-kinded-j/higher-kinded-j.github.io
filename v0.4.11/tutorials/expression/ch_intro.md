# Expression Journeys

Two journeys on for-comprehensions beyond the basics: named state records that replace positional tuples, and explicit parallel composition for independent computations.

~~~admonish tip title="Where This Fits in the Bigger Picture"
For-comprehensions are the idiom that turns chains of `flatMap` into something that reads like a sequence of statements. They sit on top of [Monad](../../functional/monad.md) (sequential) and [Applicative](../../functional/applicative.md) (parallel); the [For Comprehension](../../functional/for_comprehension.md) reference page covers the typeclass machinery these journeys build on.
