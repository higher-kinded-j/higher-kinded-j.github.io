# Context Journey

~~~admonish info title="What We'll Learn"
- Working with `ScopedValue`-backed contexts as composable values
- Threading request, security, and trace contexts through a workflow without `ThreadLocal`
- Propagating context across virtual-thread boundaries with VTask
- Combining contexts with the Effect Path API for production-shaped flows
~~~

**Tutorials**: 6 | **Exercises**: 59 | **Prerequisites**: complete the [Effect API Journey](../effect/effect_journey.md) and the [Concurrency: VTask Journey](../concurrency/vtask_journey.md) first.

~~~admonish tip title="Where This Fits in the Bigger Picture"
A `Context` is the value-level form of "the request id, principal, or trace id every part of this workflow needs". In production, [One Line, Six Layers](../../hkts/one_line_six_layers.md) almost always runs inside one or more contexts: `RequestContext` for tracing, `SecurityContext` for the principal, custom `Context` for tenant or feature-flag state. This journey teaches the patterns.

Each tutorial opens with a Pain → Promise header showing the imperative-Java pattern (`ThreadLocal`, MDC, `SecurityContextHolder`) the value-level Context replaces.
