**Requirements**: Java 25 (virtual threads and structured concurrency)

~~~admonish tip title="Where This Fits in the Bigger Picture"
`VTask` is the deferred-effect type for virtual-thread-based concurrency; it is what we reach for when the `repo.find(id)` token in [One Line, Six Layers](../../hkts/one_line_six_layers.md) is async, which it almost always is in production. `VTaskPath` lifts `VTask` into the [Effect Path API](../effect/effect_journey.md), so the same fluent shape works for sync and async code.
~~~

## Journey Overview

This journey introduces `VTask` and `VTaskPath`, Higher-Kinded-J's types for virtual thread-based concurrency. We learn to describe computations lazily, compose them functionally, and execute them on lightweight virtual threads.

By the end, you'll understand how to build concurrent applications using functional composition rather than low-level thread management.

## Tutorial 1: VTask Fundamentals
**File**: `TutorialVTask.java` | **Exercises**: 9

Master virtual thread-based concurrency with functional composition.

### Part 1: Creating VTasks

**What you'll learn**:
- Creating lazy computations with `VTask.of()` and `VTask.delay()`
- Immediate values with `VTask.succeed()` and `VTask.fail()`
- Understanding that VTask describes effects without executing them

**Key insight**: A `VTask` is a recipe, not a meal. Creating a `VTask` doesn't run anything; it just describes what *would* happen when you eventually call `run()`.

**Exercise 1**: Create a VTask that computes the length of a string
**Exercise 2**: Create a succeeding and a failing VTask

---

### Part 2: Transforming VTasks

**What you'll learn**:
- Using `map` to transform results
- Using `flatMap` to chain dependent computations
- Short-circuiting on errors automatically

**Key insight**: VTask follows the same patterns as other monads in Higher-Kinded-J. If you know `Either.flatMap`, you know `VTask.flatMap`.

**Exercise 3**: Transform a VTask result using map
**Exercise 4**: Chain dependent VTask computations with flatMap

---

### Part 3: Error Handling

**What you'll learn**:
- Using `runSafe()` to capture errors in `Try`
- Recovery with `recover` and `recoverWith`
- Transforming errors with `mapError`

**Key insight**: `runSafe()` is the preferred execution method; it captures failures in a `Try`, letting you handle errors functionally rather than with try-catch.

**Exercise 5**: Execute a VTask safely and handle the result
**Exercise 6**: Recover from a failed VTask with a default value

---

### Part 4: Parallel Composition

**What you'll learn**:
- Using `Par.zip` to run tasks in parallel
- Combining parallel results with `Par.map2`
- Racing tasks with `Par.race`
- Collecting results with `Par.all`

**Key insight**: Par combinators use `StructuredTaskScope` under the hood, ensuring proper cancellation if any task fails.

**Exercise 7**: Execute two tasks in parallel and combine results
**Exercise 8**: Race multiple tasks and get the first result

---

## Tutorial 2: VTaskPath Effect API
**File**: `TutorialVTaskPath.java` | **Exercises**: 9

Learn the fluent Effect Path API for VTask-based workflows.

### Part 1: Creating VTaskPaths

**What you'll learn**:
- Creating paths with `Path.vtask()`, `Path.vtaskPure()`, `Path.vtaskFail()`
- Understanding the relationship between VTask and VTaskPath
- Converting between VTask and VTaskPath

**Key insight**: VTaskPath wraps VTask to provide a fluent, composable API that integrates with the broader Effect Path ecosystem.

**Exercise 1**: Create a VTaskPath from a computation
**Exercise 2**: Create pure and failing VTaskPaths

---

### Part 2: Fluent Composition

**What you'll learn**:
- Chaining operations with `via()` (the Effect Path equivalent of flatMap)
- Transforming values with `map()`
- Debugging with `peek()`
- Sequencing with `then()`

**Key insight**: VTaskPath operations mirror VTask operations but use Effect Path naming conventions (`via` instead of `flatMap`) for consistency across all Path types.

**Exercise 3**: Chain VTaskPath operations with via
**Exercise 4**: Use peek for debugging a computation pipeline

---

### Part 3: Error Handling and Timeouts

**What you'll learn**:
- Safe execution with `runSafe()` returning `Try`
- Recovery patterns: `handleError()`, `handleErrorWith()`
- Timeout management with `timeout(Duration)`
- Building fallback chains

**Key insight**: Timeouts integrate naturally into the fluent API. A timeout that expires returns a failure that can be recovered from, just like any other error.

**Exercise 5**: Add a timeout to a slow operation
**Exercise 6**: Build a fallback chain with multiple recovery attempts

---

### Part 4: Real-World Patterns

**What you'll learn**:
- Service aggregation with parallel fetches
- Dashboard-style data loading
- Graceful degradation under failure

**Key insight**: Combining VTaskPath with Par combinators gives you the best of both worlds: fluent composition for individual paths and parallel execution for independent operations.

**Exercise 7**: Aggregate data from multiple services in parallel
**Exercise 8**: Build a resilient dashboard loader with timeouts and fallbacks

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Forgetting VTask is Lazy
**Problem**: Assuming a VTask runs when created.

<!-- verify -->
```java
// WRONG: This doesn't print anything yet!
VTask<Unit> task = VTask.exec(() -> System.out.println("Hello"));

// RIGHT: You must run it
task.run(); // Now it prints
```

### 2. Using run() Instead of runSafe()
**Problem**: Using `run()` and letting exceptions propagate.

<!-- verify -->
```java
// RISKY: Throws on failure
Integer thrown = VTask.of(() -> dangerousOperation()).run();

// BETTER: Captures failure in Try
Try<Integer> captured = VTask.of(() -> dangerousOperation()).runSafe();
captured.foldFailureFirst(
    error -> handleError(error),
    value -> handleSuccess(value)
);
```

### 3. Sequential When Parallel Would Work
**Problem**: Using `flatMap` for independent computations.

<!-- verify -->
```java
// SEQUENTIAL: fetchB waits for fetchA to complete
VTask<Pair> sequential = fetchA.flatMap(a ->
    fetchB.map(b -> new Pair(a, b)));

// PARALLEL: Both execute simultaneously
VTask<Pair> parallel = Par.map2(fetchA, fetchB, Pair::new);
```

### 4. Ignoring Timeouts in Production
**Problem**: Letting slow operations block indefinitely.

<!-- verify -->
```java
// RISKY: No timeout, could hang forever
VTaskPath<Data> path = Path.vtask(() -> fetchFromSlowService());

// BETTER: Add timeout with fallback
VTaskPath<Data> safe = Path.vtask(() -> fetchFromSlowService())
    .timeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
    .handleError(e -> Data.empty());
```

## Key Concepts Summary

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Laziness** | VTask/VTaskPath describes computation; nothing runs until `run()`/`runSafe()`/`runAsync()` |
| **Virtual Threads** | Execution happens on lightweight JVM-managed threads |
| **Structured Concurrency** | Par combinators ensure proper task lifecycle management |
| **Error Propagation** | Failures short-circuit chains; use `recover` (VTask) or `handleError` (VTaskPath) |
| **Timeouts** | Use `timeout(Duration)` to prevent runaway operations |
| **Effect Path Integration** | VTaskPath integrates with other Path types and ForPath comprehensions |
