## Before and After

### Without the Plugin

A manual setup requires dependencies, annotation processors, the compile-time checker, and preview flags wired into every task that needs them. The full build file runs to roughly 30 lines; see [Manual Gradle and Maven Setup](manual_setup.md) for the complete configuration.

### With the Plugin

```gradle
// build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    id("io.github.higher-kinded-j.hkj") version "LATEST_VERSION"
}
```

That is it. The plugin wires in dependencies, preview flags, compile-time checks, and Javadoc configuration automatically. It also enables "-parameters", which keeps constructor parameter names in the compiled class files: some copy strategies read them today, and the [record mapper](../mapping/ch_intro.md) uses them too. In a multi-module build, apply the plugin to **every** module that declares mapping specs or `@GenerateFocus` records other modules navigate into, not only the one that consumes them: a spec is nested through its generated `Impl` and a record is navigated through its generated `Focus`, so each must exist. See [Multi-module builds](manual_setup.md#multi-module-builds).

### Using SNAPSHOT Versions

SNAPSHOT versions of the plugin are published to the Sonatype snapshots repository. Add it to `pluginManagement` in your `settings.gradle.kts`:

```gradle
// settings.gradle.kts
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        maven {
            url = uri("https://central.sonatype.com/repository/maven-snapshots/")
        }
        gradlePluginPortal()
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

You also need the same repository in your project's `repositories` block so the plugin can resolve HKJ library dependencies:

```gradle
// build.gradle.kts
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven {
        url = uri("https://central.sonatype.com/repository/maven-snapshots/")
    }
}
```

~~~admonish note
Release versions are published to both Maven Central and the [Gradle Plugin Portal](https://plugins.gradle.org), so no extra repository configuration is needed for releases.

## Extension DSL Reference

The plugin creates an `hkj` extension block with these options:

```gradle
hkj {
    version = "LATEST_VERSION"       // HKJ library version (default: plugin version)
    preview = true           // add --enable-preview flags (default: true)
    spring = false           // add the starter and the @HkjHttpClient processor (default: false)
    skills = false           // install Claude Code skills (default: false)
    checks {
        pathTypeMismatch = true   // enable compile-time Path type checking (default: true)
    }
}
```

### Defaults

| Property | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `version` | Plugin version | Version of HKJ libraries to use |
| `preview` | `true` | Adds `--enable-preview` to compile, test, exec, and javadoc tasks |
| `spring` | `false` | Adds `hkj-spring-boot-starter` to `implementation`, and the `@HkjHttpClient` processor to every annotation processor configuration |
| `skills` | `false` | Installs Claude Code skills into `.claude/skills/` during build |
| `checks.pathTypeMismatch` | `true` | Enables compile-time Path type mismatch detection |

With default settings, the plugin adds:

- `hkj-core` to `implementation`
- `hkj-processor-plugins` to `annotationProcessor`
- `hkj-checker` to `annotationProcessor`
- `--enable-preview` to `JavaCompile`, `Test`, `JavaExec`, and `Javadoc` tasks
- `-parameters` to every `JavaCompile` task (unconditional)
- `-Xplugin:HKJChecker` to compiler arguments

---

## Spring Boot Mode

Enable Spring Boot integration to add the HKJ Spring Boot starter:

```gradle
hkj {
    spring = true
}
```

This adds `hkj-spring-boot-starter` to the `implementation` configuration, which provides auto-configuration for using HKJ types with Spring's dependency injection and web layer. It also adds `hkj-spring-boot-client-processor` to every annotation processor configuration, which generates the [`@HkjHttpClient`](../spring/declarative_http_clients.md) clients: a dependency never adds to the processor path, so the starter alone would not.

## Claude Code Skills

Install eight Claude Code skills that provide contextual, in-editor guidance for HKJ:

```gradle
hkj {
    skills = true
}
```

This runs the `hkjInstallSkills` task during every build, copying skill files into `.claude/skills/`. You can also run the task manually:

```bash
./gradlew hkjInstallSkills
```

With the Maven plugin, `<skills>true</skills>` installs them during every build too.

## Version Management

By default, the plugin uses its own published version for HKJ dependencies. Override this to pin a different version:

```gradle
hkj {
    version = "0.2.2"    // use an older version
}
```

All HKJ dependencies (`hkj-core`, `hkj-processor-plugins`, `hkj-checker`, `hkj-spring-boot-starter`, `hkj-spring-boot-client-processor`) use the same version.

---

## Disabling Features

### Disable Preview Features

If your project manages preview flags separately:

```gradle
hkj {
    preview = false
}
```

~~~admonish warning
Higher-Kinded-J requires `--enable-preview` on Java 25. Disabling this means you must configure the flags yourself, or compilation will fail.
~~~

### Disable Compile-Time Checks

To skip Path type mismatch detection:

```gradle
hkj {
    checks {
        pathTypeMismatch = false
    }
}
```

This removes `hkj-checker` from the annotation processor path and omits the `-Xplugin:HKJChecker` compiler argument.

---

## Maven Users

### With the HKJ Maven Plugin

The HKJ Maven plugin provides similar automation to the Gradle plugin. Add it with `<extensions>true</extensions>` so it can configure dependencies and compiler settings automatically:

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.github.higher-kinded-j</groupId>
            <artifactId>hkj-bom</artifactId>
            <version>LATEST_VERSION</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>

<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>io.github.higher-kinded-j</groupId>
            <artifactId>hkj-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>LATEST_VERSION</version>
            <extensions>true</extensions>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

The plugin automatically adds `hkj-core`, annotation processors, compile-time checks, and preview feature flags. Configure options in the `<configuration>` block:

```xml
<configuration>
    <version>LATEST_VERSION</version>   <!-- HKJ library version (default: plugin version) -->
    <preview>true</preview>              <!-- add --enable-preview flags (default: true) -->
    <spring>false</spring>               <!-- add hkj-spring-boot-starter and the @HkjHttpClient processor (default: false) -->
    <skills>false</skills>               <!-- install Claude Code skills (default: false) -->
    <pathTypeMismatch>true</pathTypeMismatch>  <!-- enable compile-time checks (default: true) -->
</configuration>
```

The plugin writes `<annotationProcessorPaths>` into every compiler execution, which replaces javac's processor discovery, so list any other processor, such as Lombok, there too. A build that names its processors in `<annotationProcessors>` gets HKJ's added to that list while `<version>` is unset or names the plugin's own release, and no HKJ processor on the path is pinned to another. Otherwise list them yourself: they are the names in that release's `hkj-processor` jar, under `META-INF/services/javax.annotation.processing.Processor`. Run diagnostics with `mvn hkj:diagnostics` or install skills with `mvn hkj:install-skills`.

### Manual Maven Setup

Projects that cannot apply the Maven plugin should see [Manual Gradle and Maven Setup](manual_setup.md) for the full `pom.xml`, including the BOM, annotation processors, the `HKJChecker` compiler plugin, and the preview flags for surefire and exec plugins.

~~~admonish info title="Key Takeaways"
* **One line** (Gradle) or a short plugin block (Maven) replaces extensive build configuration
* **Sensible defaults** enable preview features and compile-time checks out of the box
* **Claude Code skills** bring contextual HKJ guidance directly into your editor
* **Everything is optional** and can be disabled or overridden through DSL/configuration
* **The BOM** manages versions across all HKJ modules for both Gradle and Maven
