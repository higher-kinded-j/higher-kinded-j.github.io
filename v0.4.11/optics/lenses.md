~~~

A Lens focuses on a single, required field within a record: the `address` in a `User`, the `street` in an `Address`. It exposes `get`, `set`, and `modify`, and composes with other lenses to reach any depth without hand-written copy cascades. Where a record's `withX` method copies one record, a lens reaches through nested ones ([Why a lens, when you have `@With`?](#lens-or-wither)).

## The Scenario: Updating an Employee's Address

Let's use a common business scenario involving a deeply nested data structure. Our goal is to update the `street` of an `Employee`'s `Company`'s `Address`.

**The Data Model:**

<!-- verify -->
```java
public record Address(String street, String city) {}
public record Company(String name, Address address) {}
public record Employee(String name, Company company) {}
```

Without optics, changing the street requires manually rebuilding the entire `Employee` object graph. With optics, we can define a direct path to the `street` and perform the update in a single, declarative line.

---

## A Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### Step 1: Generating the Lenses

Manually writing `Lens` implementations is tedious boilerplate. The `hkj-optics` library automates this with an annotation processor. To begin, we simply annotate our records with **`@GenerateLenses`**.

This process creates a companion class for each record (e.g., `EmployeeLenses`, `CompanyLenses`) that contains two key features:

1. **Lens Factories**: Static methods that create a `Lens` for each field (e.g., `EmployeeLenses.company()`).
2. **`with*` Helpers**: Static convenience methods for easy, shallow updates (e.g., `EmployeeLenses.withCompany(...)`).

<!-- verify -->
```java
import org.higherkindedj.optics.annotations.GenerateLenses;

@GenerateLenses
public record Address(String street, String city) {}

@GenerateLenses
public record Company(String name, Address address) {}

@GenerateLenses
public record Employee(String name, Company company) {}
```

#### Every Write Runs the Canonical Constructor

A generated lens's `set`, and the `with*` helper built on it, copies the record through its canonical constructor: every other component as it was, and the focused one replaced. A compact constructor that normalises or checks a component, a defensive copy or a range check, therefore runs on every write.

Another constructor the record declares is never the one called, even one taking as many parameters:

```java
public record Money(long cents, String currency) {
  public Money(Number major, String currency) {
    this(Math.round(major.doubleValue() * 100), currency);
  }
}

// 1234 cents, through Money(long, String); never the Number constructor
Money updated = MoneyLenses.cents().set(1234L, money);
```

The setters and Focus paths that `@GenerateSetters` and `@GenerateFocus` generate write the same way, as do the lenses `@ImportOptics` generates for a record.

#### Customising the Generated Package

By default, generated classes are placed in the same package as the annotated record. You can specify a different package using the `targetPackage` attribute to avoid name collisions or to organise generated code separately:

```java
// Generated class will be placed in org.example.generated.optics
@GenerateLenses(targetPackage = "org.example.generated.optics")
public record Address(String street, String city) {}
```

This is particularly useful when:
- Multiple records in different packages share the same name
- You want to keep generated code separate from source code
- You need to control the visibility of generated classes

### Step 2: Composing a Deep Lens

With the lenses generated, we can now compose them using the **`andThen`** method. We'll chain the individual lenses together to create a single, new `Lens` that represents the complete path from the top-level object (`Employee`) to the deeply nested field (`street`).

The result is a new, powerful, and reusable `Lens<Employee, String>`.

<!-- verify -->
```java
// Get the generated lenses
Lens<Employee, Company> employeeToCompany = EmployeeLenses.company();
Lens<Company, Address> companyToAddress = CompanyLenses.address();
Lens<Address, String> addressToStreet = AddressLenses.street();

// Compose them to create a single, deep lens
Lens<Employee, String> employeeToStreet =
    employeeToCompany
        .andThen(companyToAddress)
        .andThen(addressToStreet);
```

### Step 3: Performing Updates with the Composed Lens

With our optics generated, we have two primary ways to perform updates.

#### A) Simple, Shallow Updates with `with*` Helpers

For simple updates to a top-level field, the generated `with*` methods are the most convenient and readable option.

<!-- verify -->
```java
// Create an employee instance
var employee = new Employee("Alice", new Company("Initech Inc.", initialAddress));

// Use the generated helper to create an updated copy
var updatedEmployee = EmployeeLenses.withName(employee, "Bob");
```

This is a cleaner, more discoverable alternative to using the lens directly (`EmployeeLenses.name().set("Bob", employee)`).

#### B) Deep Updates with a Composed Lens

For deep updates into nested structures, the composed lens is the perfect tool. The `Lens` interface provides two primary methods for this:

* `set(newValue, object)`: Replaces the focused value with a new one.
* `modify(function, object)`: Applies a function to the focused value to compute the new value.

Both methods handle the "copy-and-update" cascade for you, returning a completely new top-level object.

<!-- verify -->
```java
// Use the composed lens from Step 2
Employee updatedEmployee = employeeToStreet.set("456 Main St", initialEmployee);
```

---

## When to Use `with*` Helpers vs Manual Lenses

Understanding when to use each approach will help you write cleaner, more maintainable code:

### Use `with*` Helpers When:

* **Simple, top-level field updates** - Direct field replacement on the immediate object
* **One-off updates** - You don't need to reuse the update logic
* **API clarity** - You want the most discoverable, IDE-friendly approach


<!-- verify -->
```java
// Perfect for simple updates
var promotedEmployee = EmployeeLenses.withName(employee, "Senior " + employee.name());
```

### Use Composed Lenses When:

* **Deep updates** - Navigating multiple levels of nesting
* **Reusable paths** - The same update pattern will be used multiple times
* **Complex transformations** - Using `modify()` with functions
* **Conditional updates** - Part of larger optic compositions


<!-- verify -->
```java
// Ideal for reusable deep updates
Lens<Employee, String> streetLens = employeeToCompany
    .andThen(companyToAddress)
    .andThen(addressToStreet);

// Can be reused across your application
Employee moved = streetLens.set("New Office Street", employee);
Employee uppercased = streetLens.modify(String::toUpperCase, employee);
```

~~~admonish tip title="Cross-Optic Composition"
Lenses can also compose with other optic types. When you compose a `Lens` with a `Prism`, you get an `Affine` (the prism may not match, so the focus becomes zero-or-one):

<!-- verify -->
```java
// Lens >>> Prism = Affine
@GenerateLenses
record User(Optional<Settings> settings) {}
Lens<User, Optional<Settings>> settingsLens = UserLenses.settings();
Prism<Optional<Settings>, Settings> somePrism = Prisms.some();

Affine<User, Settings> userSettings = settingsLens.andThen(somePrism);
```

See [Composition Rules](composition_rules.md) for the complete reference on how different optics compose.
~~~

### Use Manual Lens Creation When:

* **Computed properties** - The lens represents derived data
* **Complex transformations** - Custom getter/setter logic
* **Legacy integration** - Working with existing APIs


<!-- verify -->
```java
// For computed or derived properties
Lens<Employee, String> fullAddressLens = Lens.of(
    emp -> emp.company().address().street() + ", " + emp.company().address().city(),
    (emp, fullAddr) -> {
        String[] parts = fullAddr.split(", ");
        return employeeToCompany.andThen(companyToAddress).set(
            new Address(parts[0], parts[1]), emp);
    }
);
```

## Why a lens, when you have `@With`? {#lens-or-wither}

Lombok's `@With`, a hand-written `withX` method and the generated `with*` helpers are all withers: each copies one record with one component replaced. For a change one level deep and made once, a wither is enough, as [When to Use `with*` Helpers vs Manual Lenses](#when-to-use-with-helpers-vs-manual-lenses) says. For a change that goes deeper, is reused, or carries an effect, a lens earns its place.

A wither knows only its own record. A change three records deep takes one wither per level, each nested inside the next. Here it is with the instance withers Lombok's `@With` generates:

``` java
    Employee moved =
        employee.withCompany(
            employee.company().withAddress(employee.company().address().withStreet("456 Main St")));
```

`employee.company()` appears twice, because each level reads the path again. The composed lens from [Step 2](#step-2-composing-a-deep-lens) makes the same change in one call, `employeeToStreet.set("456 Main St", employee)`, and it is a value you can store and reuse. Two more jobs need a lens:

- **A lens updates by function, and by effect.** `modify` reads and writes the path in one call, and [`modifyF`](#beyond-the-basics-effectful-updates-with-modifyf) runs a check or a lookup on the way. A wither takes only the new value.
- **Coupled fields need one construction.** Take `Range(int lo, int hi)`, whose constructor refuses `lo > hi`. On `Range(1, 3)`, `withLo(5).withHi(10)` fails on `Range(5, 3)`, and which order works depends on the direction of the move. Two lens writes fail alike; [`Lens.paired`](coupled_fields.md) constructs once.

Neither creates a value, so a lens can replace `@With`, never `@Builder`. A class built with Lombok gets lenses through [`@Wither` or `@ViaBuilder`](copy_strategies.md), with Lombok listed before `hkj-processor` ([Lombok setup](../tooling/manual_setup.md#lombok)).

Java 25, which the library is built on today, has no wither in the language. [JEP 468](https://openjdk.org/jeps/468) proposes one: a `with` block that changes any components of one record through one constructor call. A block constructs once, as `Lens.paired` does, but it changes one record, so the street change nests three blocks where the composed lens is one call.

## Common Pitfalls

### Don't Do This:


<!-- verify -->
```java
// Inefficient: Calling get() multiple times
var currentStreet = employeeToStreet.get(employee);
var newEmployee = employeeToStreet.set(currentStreet.toUpperCase(), employee);

// Verbose: Rebuilding lenses repeatedly
var street1 = EmployeeLenses.company().andThen(CompanyLenses.address()).andThen(AddressLenses.street()).get(emp1);
var street2 = EmployeeLenses.company().andThen(CompanyLenses.address()).andThen(AddressLenses.street()).get(emp2);

// Mixing approaches unnecessarily
var tempCompany = EmployeeLenses.company().get(employee);
var updatedCompany = CompanyLenses.withName(tempCompany, "New Company");
var finalEmployee = EmployeeLenses.withCompany(employee, updatedCompany);
```

### Do This Instead:


<!-- verify -->
```java
// Efficient: Use modify() for transformations
var newEmployee = employeeToStreet.modify(String::toUpperCase, employee);

// Reusable: Create the lens once, use many times
var streetLens = EmployeeLenses.company().andThen(CompanyLenses.address()).andThen(AddressLenses.street());
var street1 = streetLens.get(emp1);
var street2 = streetLens.get(emp2);

// Consistent: Use one approach for the entire update
var finalEmployee = EmployeeLenses.company()
    .andThen(CompanyLenses.name())
    .set("New Company", employee);
```

## Performance Notes

Lenses are optimised for immutable updates:

* **Memory efficient**: Only creates new objects along the path that changes
* **Reusable**: Composed lenses can be stored and reused across your application
* **Type-safe**: All operations are checked at compile time
* **Lazy**: Operations are only performed when needed

**Best Practice**: For frequently used paths, create the composed lens once and store it as a static field:

<!-- verify -->
```java
public class EmployeeOptics {
    public static final Lens<Employee, String> STREET = 
        EmployeeLenses.company()
            .andThen(CompanyLenses.address())
            .andThen(AddressLenses.street());
        
    public static final Lens<Employee, String> COMPANY_NAME = 
        EmployeeLenses.company()
            .andThen(CompanyLenses.name());
}
```

## Complete, Runnable Example

The following standalone example puts all these steps together. You can run it to see the output and the immutability in action.

```java
package org.higherkindedj.example.lens;

// The generated AddressLenses / CompanyLenses / EmployeeLenses are top-level classes in this
// same package, so they need no import.
import org.higherkindedj.optics.Lens;
import org.higherkindedj.optics.annotations.GenerateLenses;
import java.util.List;

public class LensUsageExample {

    // 1. Define a nested, immutable data model.
    @GenerateLenses
    public record Address(String street, String city) {}

    @GenerateLenses
    public record Company(String name, Address address) {}

    @GenerateLenses
    public record Employee(String name, Company company) {}


    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // 2. Create an initial, nested immutable object.
        var initialAddress = new Address("123 Fake St", "Anytown");
        var initialCompany = new Company("Initech Inc.", initialAddress);
        var initialEmployee = new Employee("Alice", initialCompany);

        System.out.println("Original Employee: " + initialEmployee);
        System.out.println("------------------------------------------");


        // --- SCENARIO 1: Simple update with a `with*` helper ---
        System.out.println("--- Scenario 1: Using `with*` Helper ---");
        var employeeWithNewName = EmployeeLenses.withName(initialEmployee, "Bob");
        System.out.println("After `withName`:    " + employeeWithNewName);
        System.out.println("------------------------------------------");

        // --- SCENARIO 2: Deep update with a composed Lens ---
        System.out.println("--- Scenario 2: Using Composed Lens ---");
        Lens<Employee, String> employeeToStreet =
            EmployeeLenses.company()
                .andThen(CompanyLenses.address())
                .andThen(AddressLenses.street());

        // Use `set` to replace a value
        Employee updatedEmployeeSet = employeeToStreet.set("456 Main St", initialEmployee);
        System.out.println("After deep `set`:       " + updatedEmployeeSet);

        // Use `modify` to apply a function
        Employee updatedEmployeeModify = employeeToStreet.modify(String::toUpperCase, initialEmployee);
        System.out.println("After deep `modify`:    " + updatedEmployeeModify);
        System.out.println("Original is unchanged:  " + initialEmployee);
      
        // --- SCENARIO 3: Demonstrating reusability ---
        System.out.println("--- Scenario 3: Reusing Composed Lens ---");
        var employee2 = new Employee("Charlie", new Company("Tech Corp", new Address("789 Oak Ave", "Tech City")));
      
        // Same lens works on different employee instances
        var bothUpdated = List.of(initialEmployee, employee2)
            .stream()
            .map(emp -> employeeToStreet.modify(street -> "Remote: " + street, emp))
            .toList();
          
        System.out.println("Batch updated: " + bothUpdated);
    }
}
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Original Employee: Employee[name=Alice, company=Company[name=Initech Inc., address=Address[street=123 Fake St, city=Anytown]]]
------------------------------------------
--- Scenario 1: Using `with*` Helper ---
After `withName`:    Employee[name=Bob, company=Company[name=Initech Inc., address=Address[street=123 Fake St, city=Anytown]]]
------------------------------------------
--- Scenario 2: Using Composed Lens ---
After deep `set`:       Employee[name=Alice, company=Company[name=Initech Inc., address=Address[street=456 Main St, city=Anytown]]]
After deep `modify`:    Employee[name=Alice, company=Company[name=Initech Inc., address=Address[street=123 FAKE ST, city=Anytown]]]
Original is unchanged:  Employee[name=Alice, company=Company[name=Initech Inc., address=Address[street=123 Fake St, city=Anytown]]]
------------------------------------------
--- Scenario 3: Reusing Composed Lens ---
Batch updated: [Employee[name=Alice, company=Company[name=Initech Inc., address=Address[street=Remote: 123 Fake St, city=Anytown]]], Employee[name=Charlie, company=Company[name=Tech Corp, address=Address[street=Remote: 789 Oak Ave, city=Tech City]]]]
```

As you can see, the generated optics provide a clean, declarative, and type-safe API for working with immutable data, whether your updates are simple and shallow or complex and deep.

---

## Beyond the Basics: Effectful Updates with `modifyF`

While `set` and `modify` are for simple, pure updates, the `Lens` interface also supports effectful operations through `modifyF`. This method allows you to perform updates within a context like an `Optional`, `Validated`, or `CompletableFuture`.

This means you can use the same `employeeToStreet` lens to perform a street name update that involves failable validation or an asynchronous API call.

~~~admonish tip title="Why this matters"
This is the point where these lenses part company with hand-rolled `withX` helpers and reflective mappers: the *path* and the *effect* are independent. You define `employeeToStreet` once; whether an update through it is pure, validated with every error accumulated, or awaited from an async call is decided at the call site by the `Applicative` you hand to `modifyF`. No second path to maintain, and no way for the effectful variant to drift from the pure one.
~~~

```java
// Example: Street validation that might fail
Function<String, Kind<ValidatedKind.Witness<String>, String>> validateStreet = 
    street -> street.length() > 0 && street.length() < 100 
        ? VALIDATED.widen(Validated.valid(street))
        : VALIDATED.widen(Validated.invalid("Street name must be between 1 and 100 characters"));

// Use the same lens with effectful validation
Kind<ValidatedKind.Witness<String>, Employee> result =
    employeeToStreet.modifyF(validateStreet, employee, validatedApplicative);
```

~~~admonish tip title="For Comprehension Integration"
Lenses integrate with For comprehensions in two ways:
- Use `focus()` within a For comprehension to extract values via lens-like accessors. See [For Comprehensions: Extracting Values with focus()](../functional/for_optics.md#extracting-nested-values-with-focus).
- Use `ForState` for stateful lens operations that thread updates through a workflow. See [For Comprehensions: Stateful Updates with ForState](../functional/for_mtl.md#stateful-updates-with-forstate).
~~~

~~~admonish info title="Key Takeaways"
* **A lens is a first-class path to a required field**: `get`, `set`, and `modify`, with the copy-and-update cascade handled for you
* **Compose with `andThen` to any depth**: build the path once, store it as a constant, reuse it everywhere
* **Withers for shallow, composed lenses for deep**: the generated `with*` helpers, Lombok's `@With` and hand-written withers each change one record; composition covers the rest, and `Lens.paired` changes coupled components at once
* **Prefer `modify` over get-then-set**, and `modifyF` when the update carries an effect (validation, async) through the same path
